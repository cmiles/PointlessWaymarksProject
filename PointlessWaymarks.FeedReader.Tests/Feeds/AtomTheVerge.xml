    <title>This is the new Hulu experience with live TV</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s7_GCGLStRq2FzYVVHkBnB5PpII=/10x0:2335x1550/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52636835/Screen_Shot_2017_01_06_at_3.15.55_PM.0.png" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="MgoyH9"&gt;Hulu is giving closed-door demonstrations of its upcoming internet TV service here at CES in Las Vegas. The fact that Hulu plans to challenge Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, and DirecTV Now isnâ€™t new; the company has been trickling out details â€” network agreements, mainly â€” over the last few months. This week Hulu revealed that its service will be priced at under $40 monthly. For reference, Sling starts at $20-per-month, Vue at $30 (or $40 in markets with live network programming), and DirecTV Now at $35. Iâ€™ve now seen what Huluâ€™s been working on, albeit very briefly, and it shows a lot of promise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="78WfPT"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UvmiRhdnrrk?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;autohide=1&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" style="top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RN3Sru"&gt;For Huluâ€™s asking price, youâ€™ll get live TV, two simultaneous streams, a cloud DVR feature (with a â€œsmallâ€ amount of storage according to SVP Ben Smith), plus the on-demand TV shows that the service is known for â€” movies, too. I had a chance to tour through a â€œnear-pixel-perfectâ€ demo of the new Hulu experience with Smith earlier this morning. Unfortunately, I wasnâ€™t allowed to take photos or videos during the walkthrough, which is why every story youâ€™ll read about this service uses the same three photos and teaser video. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KfTILS75MWCdy_H6adFYqp1ZlGI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7765995/Hulu_tastepicker.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y8ZrNb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Watch two streams at once, or pay for more&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vk7nkC"&gt;Where Hulu is trying to differentiate itself from everyone else is with the experience. When you open the app, youâ€™ll go through an on-boarding process thatâ€™s similar to signing up for Apple Music (and Beats Music before it). Hulu asks you to choose your favorite TV genres. After that, youâ€™ll get a bit more granular and pick some individual show favorites, and the last step is ticking off your preferred cable networks. Done. You can skip right through all this, but Smith said that spending the couple minutes to complete it will drastically improve suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQGaIW"&gt;From there, the first menu youâ€™ll see is called your Lineup. Here, Hulu gathers everything it thinks you want to watch right away. This can be a mix of live television and on-demand reruns of an episode you mightâ€™ve missed. You can tell Hulu to stop recommending content youâ€™ve got no interest in, and Smith said networks and advertisers wonâ€™t be able to ruin this section with paid placement. Curated collections of movies and other content &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;be sponsored, but those are located elsewhere in the app and easy to ignore. The Lineup will change depending on your viewing habits and the time of day, as it takes into account whatâ€™s most popular and when. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/34dXHup6PKowa-DuzX3iupsPZOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7765975/Bens_Lineup.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Lineup is customized to each profile on your Hulu account.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zOOOxJ"&gt;Move over to the next menu section and youâ€™re shown a far more thorough content selection, where existing Hulu users will feel at home. Youâ€™ve got your favorite shows, and can also scroll through separate areas for TV, movies, and those featured collections I mentioned earlier. Thereâ€™s also a helpful section that highlights everything thatâ€™ll be leaving Hulu soon, giving you a chance to watch before itâ€™s gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7KCao"&gt;This part of the new Hulu looks fairly similar to PlayStation Vue. Thatâ€™s something that can be said for a lot of the new look, actually. The main Lineup screen and its big text are an exception, but elsewhere a lot of this seems to be building off of Vueâ€™s foundation. Itâ€™s heavy on big TV show artwork, like so: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Eg_4iZKkNw8fUmuH8BM0ETfB9o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7766225/Hulu_Fliptray.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mlgmV2"&gt;There are only so many ways to build a TV interface, and I definitely prefer this style to what Sling TV and DirecTV Now are doing. The third menu column â€” the one with a grid of four rectangles â€” is about as close as Hulu gets to any sort of traditional on-screen â€œguide.â€ And thereâ€™s still really not one. You can look at whatâ€™s currently airing on live TV network by network, but thereâ€™s nothing resembling a cable guide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srx6Bl"&gt;When youâ€™re watching something and pull up the menu, Hulu prioritizes your most recent channels first, so itâ€™s easy to switch back and forth if youâ€™re trying to keep up with multiple shows or sports. Smith wasnâ€™t able to demo the appâ€™s search section during our demonstration, but said itâ€™s an area that Hulu is putting a lot of work into.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/plFWoPCcjss2-uAyuyzm67XK8VA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7766309/watchlater.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lrWa1Z"&gt;Hulu faces some of the same hurdles as its competitors, however. As with PlayStation Vue and DirecTV Now, itâ€™s highly doubtful that live programming from the big four networks will be available in many markets outside big cities. And then youâ€™ve got the random annoyances brought about by licensing deals. Youâ€™ll be able to restart &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; shows already in progress, but not everything. Smith confirmed that users will at the very least be able to pause any network or show, and you can also rewind to whatever point you started watching from. The cloud DVR is also free of obvious, irritating restrictions, from what Iâ€™ve been told. Hopefully thatâ€™s true, because cable customers arenâ€™t used to these weird obstacles and they could potentially prevent some people from making the switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zbH7ig"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hulu genuinely seems to be putting experience first&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O4HtG8"&gt;I think whatâ€™s got me most excited about Huluâ€™s attempt at internet TV is the people behind it. Ben Smith and Richard Irving, VP of product management, worked at Microsoft and on the Xbox team for years. Their vision for reinventing TV certainly didnâ€™t pan out on a video game console, but Huluâ€™s move to unite live TV and on-demand is letting them take another stab at it. There are no potential conflicts here, which canâ€™t be said of Sling TV (owned by Dish) and DirecTV Now (owned by AT&amp;amp;T, which owns DirecTVâ€™s satellite business.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KhsLt"&gt;No one has managed to nail this yet. Hopefully Hulu will be get us a little closer. But both Sling TV and DirecTV Now have promised big improvements to their services in the coming months, and YouTube is working on &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. So perhaps by this time next year, someone&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will have perfected the cable replacement â€” or at least come close enough for most of us. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q2pZmqpTJtCyfC45F-VcrwkGw7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7766347/rewind.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MOA31k"&gt;Onto the TL:DR FAQ we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aA5ia0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatâ€™s it called?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hmhXXt"&gt;Hulu. Just Hulu. Not Hulu Live or Hulu TV or anything like that. Hulu is combining live, linear TV and its existing on-demand service into a single, completely redesigned app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbDOQT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When does it launch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTdD8z"&gt;â€œIn the coming months.â€ Hulu has been actively testing the service among employees and family / friends, and plans to offer a public beta as well. Smith said the goal is to work out any kinks over the spring / summer and have a polished, feedback-driven product by next fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0Zg2W"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many channels will it have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4Zj2X"&gt;Unknown. The company hasnâ€™t publicly commented on what its channel lineup will look like. Hulu has signed agreements with ABC (including Disney and ESPN), CBS, and Fox. It hasnâ€™t yet finalized a deal with NBCUniversal, but the company is optimistic about getting one in place by launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSPQST"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will it have &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJAKje"&gt;Potentially! Huluâ€™s on-demand service doesnâ€™t currently stream TVâ€™s most popular show, but if itâ€™s carried by the live service, youâ€™ll be able to record it with Huluâ€™s cloud DVR. The live TV half of this new Hulu might be able to make up for holes in the SVOD catalog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5TtEE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many devices can I stream on at the same time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEoYJ0"&gt;The base monthly subscription allows &lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt; simultaneous streams. Thatâ€™s going to result in the same frustration and complaints that some consumers expressed at the launch of DirecTV Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwxkfk"&gt;But! Hulu is planning to offer an extra (paid) monthly add-on that dramatically increases the stream limit to a number where â€œyouâ€™d never have to worry about it,â€ Smith told me. PlayStation Vue continues to lead the pack here, as its base package allows up to five simultaneous streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mo4ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much cloud DVR space do I get?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFDpgM"&gt;Unknown. Ben Smith described the amount included with the sub-$40 package as â€œsmall.â€ Just like with the streaming limit, subscribers will be able to pay more each month to increase cloud storage. If a TV show is available in Huluâ€™s traditional SVOD catalog after youâ€™ve recorded it, the app can replace your cloud recording with the on-demand version to conserve DVR space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXXPcb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else is different about what Huluâ€™s doing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifBV8f"&gt;Notifications, for one. Hulu will let you choose sports youâ€™re interested in and select your favorite teams. Youâ€™ll be notified when games featuring those teams are about to start. But even for sports that youâ€™re just casually interested in, Hulu might send you a notification when any game is getting particularly interesting or fun to watch â€” just as you see in that video. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SR21Fmtnp8XbTNDbDYsbl7yCKMs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7766351/Screen_Shot_2017_01_06_at_3.00.37_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IWLQQy"&gt;Notifications will also be sent to alert you of expiring content. Itâ€™s expected that users will get granular control over this stuff; all it takes is a few annoying notifications for someone to switch them off permanently. Hulu doesnâ€™t want that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIJrtx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about sports?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="In5OVd"&gt;If live ABC, CBS, and Fox are offered in your area, you can watch whatever game is on. (Blackout rules probably apply). Verizon still has its stranglehold on watching NFL games with your smartphone, but any other device should be fair game. Other regional sports channels like Fox Sports will be included, according to Smith. But Hulu hasnâ€™t reached agreements with certain team-centric stations like YES and the LA Dodgers network.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge Awards at CES 2017: Hi, Alexa</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OlmxvXYhyMKZtDLpyntxtHMvazk=/137x0:1640x1002/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52574303/Verge_CES_Awards_v3_LHeroImage.0.0.png" /&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;For at least the second year in a row, CES was quiet. Much like 2016's show, this year's consumer electronics spectacle lacked blockbuster products, brands behaving badly, or unpredictable trends. Technology, whether it's our phones, TVs, or computers, is in its adult period, where changes happen slowly and iteratively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was still movement at CES this year. Self-driving technology took a couple more baby steps forward, while the smart home continued to expand and develop. Even the age-old PC was interesting, as Windows laptops showed they could have sleek designs with great battery life; monitors grew even larger and got more pixels; and the lowly Chromebook was imbued with new life (and a stylus).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inescapable trend this year was from a company that wasn't even officially at the show. Amazon's Alexa technology showed up &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;, from cars, to TVs, to watches, to things that even looked and worked an awful lot like Amazon's own Echo devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn't a breakout star this year, but there was still a lot of stuff to see and a lot of interesting ideas on display. The thing about living in the future is that it's hard to see it coming, but rest assured, the future is here and you're in it. Here's the stuff that we found most interesting at this year's show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;â€” Dan Seifert&lt;/em&gt; &lt;div id="change-me-in-the-spreadsheet__graphic" data-analytics-label="change-me-in-the-spreadsheet" data-analytics-viewport="graphic"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--
(function() {
  var l = function() {
    new pym.Parent(
      'change-me-in-the-spreadsheet__graphic',
      'https://apps.voxmedia.com/graphics/theverge-ces-awards-2017/');
  };
  if(typeof(pym) === 'undefined') {
    var h = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0],
        s = document.createElement('script');
    s.type = 'text/javascript';
    s.src = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pym/0.4.5/pym.js';
    s.onload = l;
    h.appendChild(s);
  } else {
    l();
  }
})();
// --&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Russia is erasing Linkedin from app stores</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ahDdJb0MH2Id-cvbuDj-GTK7ngw=/0x0:4412x2941/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52637725/630609166.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="ALzsri"&gt;Apple and Google have agreed to remove LinkedIn from iOS and Android app stores in Russia, according to a new report &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/technology/linkedin-blocked-in-russia.html?_r=0"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In November, the service was ruled to be in violation of &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/4/5871565/russia-passes-law-requiring-online-personal-data-to-be-stored-inside-its-borders"&gt;a 2014 law&lt;/a&gt; requiring all data collected on Russian citizens to be stored within Russian borders. Moving data within Russian borders has been widely viewed as a first step towards more aggressive surveillance measures, and many web companies have declined to relocate their data centers to comply with the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppsoUh"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/6/13855408/microsoft-linkedin-acquisition-cleared"&gt;Acquired by Microsoft last year&lt;/a&gt;, LinkedIn is the largest service to fall victim to the new law so far. Web access to LinkedIn was &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-linkedin-diplomacy-idUSKBN13D0ST"&gt;blocked in November&lt;/a&gt; through cooperation with the state telecom, but was still accessible to users with a VPN. The block caused serious problems for the mobile apps, but they remained available on iOS and Android app stores in the wake of that order. That has now changed, and the app is no longer available to download in either store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oamwq9"&gt;Apple drew fire earlier this week for &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/business/media/new-york-times-apps-apple-china.html"&gt;withdrawing the New York Times app&lt;/a&gt; in China under similar pressure. China blocked web access to the Times in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="47D2Yg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gone from both app stores&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ithAkC"&gt;While Russiaâ€™s data localization measures are particularly aggressive, itâ€™s far from the only country to adopt such measures. The Information Technology Industry Council tallies a total of thirteen countries with &lt;a href="https://www.itic.org/public-policy/SnapshotofDataLocalizationMeasures7-29-2016.pdf"&gt;some form of data localization law&lt;/a&gt;, including the United States, which requires Department of Defense partners to store the divisionâ€™s data within U.S. borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8z9mdk"&gt;Still, the move is likely to inflame tensions between Russia and the US, which have hit a peak in recent weeks. Earlier today, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/6/14191002/us-releases-declassified-report-on-russian-hacking"&gt;a public report&lt;/a&gt; accusing Russia of mounting an espionage campaign that included the leaking of email archives from the Democratic National Committee, with the ultimate aim of swaying the US presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqgL2Z"&gt;â€œWe assess Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes,â€ the report concludes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Nick Offerman react to the nonsense gadgets of CES 2017</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GikTxKGOGNmuFQXLTbOSsf3s9kY=/52x0:585x355/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52637265/Screen_Shot_2017-01-06_at_5.58.33_PM.0.0.png" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="M21m8M"&gt;CES is as much about the future as it about the junk that gets left behind. Here in the cavernous halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center and the suites of the city's most opulent hotels and casinos, we see a lot of gadgets that spring up out of nowhere as fast as they fade into obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a promotional campaign for his American Greetings brand of greeting cards, &lt;i&gt;Parks and Recreations &lt;/i&gt;star Nick Offerman came to Vegas to opine about the pitfalls of modern technology. As part of the campaign, the gruff and deadpan lover of whiskey and woodworking toured some of the show's lovably weird nonsense with &lt;i&gt;The Verge&lt;/i&gt;'s own Casey Newton this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the video above to see him spanking a robot, look perplexingly at a camera toothbrush, and fail to escape his PR handlers on an electric scooter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>15 questions and answers about Underworld: Blood Wars</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SuBuMTxqF_XyFPR9AdWeQ8sAeoQ=/305x0:1055x500/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52636839/UnderworldFrostedTips.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="fuVY5j"&gt;The latest &lt;em&gt;Underworld &lt;/em&gt;movie just hit theaters. It wasnâ€™t screened for critics, with good reason: This is a review-proof movie. In fact, there isnâ€™t much point in reviewing it, since itâ€™s so clearly a fan-service movie, made with franchise fans in mind. So instead, hereâ€™s a rundown of mildly spoilery questions that address what goes on in the movie, who itâ€™s for, how silly it all gets, and whether the movie lets Kate Beckinsale keep jumping from high objects and landing in a perfect superheroine crouch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vI3U1L"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KQs6h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So are there any blood wars in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underworld: Blood Wars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, or is that just a fancy name?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8DbfKe"&gt;There are actually multiple blood wars in the movie! The overarching one is the 1,500-year battle between vampires and lycans (that is, werewolves) that has defined the &lt;em&gt;Underworld &lt;/em&gt;series since the first installment, 2003â€™s &lt;em&gt;Underworld&lt;/em&gt;. But thereâ€™s also a secondary one thatâ€™s also run throughout the entire series: the war for control of the vampire faction, which is fought via guns, swords, a treacherous political web of intrigue, and a lot of ponderous speeches, usually made while staring off into the middle distance and wearing a lot of black leather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEQCA9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the fifth &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underworld &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;movie. Usually by this deep into a series, the original stars have disappeared. Did that happen here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZAEg8"&gt;Kate Beckinsale, the star of the original &lt;em&gt;Underworld&lt;/em&gt;, is still playing the seriesâ€™ protagonist, a vampire named Selene whoâ€™s considered the most lethal, unstoppable fighter in the vampire/lycan wars. Seleneâ€™s hybrid vampire/werewolf lover Michael (Scott Speedman) checked out after the second installment in the franchise, and so did original director Len Wiseman. Every series entry since then has had a different director. This installment is the directorial debut of Anna Foerster, a special-effects specialist who graduated to TV direction with series like &lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Outlander&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izA0sP"&gt;The seriesâ€™ original recurring characters, played by Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy, died off a while back, but Charles Dance and Theo James are back as patrician vampire elder Thomas and his broody son David. Those two were introduced in 2012â€™s &lt;em&gt;Underworld: Awakening&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AxYOKx"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QSlaWHDu5WU?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;autohide=1&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" style="top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="umQrD7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, Charles Dance? I loved him on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Of Thrones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. How much is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underworld: Blood Wars &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;like &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Of Thrones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I1XeUr"&gt;There are a surprising number of similarities, including an entire new sub-group of vampires who all look and dress exactly like Daenerys Targaryen on &lt;em&gt;Game Of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, and apparently get their super-fake-looking bone-white wigs from the same hairdresser she uses. Also, Charles Dance pretty  much plays the same character he did on &lt;em&gt;Game Of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, except heâ€™s a vampire now, and he clearly cares about his son for non-political reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANCp8X"&gt;But that aside, the &lt;em&gt;Underworld &lt;/em&gt;movies are really, &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;densely packed with political maneuvering and scheming, and with people standing around in beautifully elaborate leather clothing, and with people abruptly getting their throats cut. Even though most of the films take place in the present day, and there are a lot of modern weapons in use, the characters spend a lot of time going after each other with swords and knives. Bloodlines are incredibly important, and &lt;em&gt;Blood Wars &lt;/em&gt;has a â€œguess the secret parentageâ€ plot thatâ€™s pretty reminiscent of Jon Snowâ€™s big reveal in &lt;em&gt;Thrones&lt;/em&gt;. Thereâ€™s an ancestral sword in this movie, presented to the scion of a noble family in another scene that feels really familiar. Both series feature betrayal after betrayal after betrayal, most of them punctuated with murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5ECEn"&gt;But perhaps most importantly, both series have reached a point where the backstory is more important than anything actually going on onscreen at any given moment, because thereâ€™s so much of it, and it affects every move the characters make, and every throat they cut or spine they rip out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTgMYu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I donâ€™t remember any spine-ripping in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Of Thrones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tri3Ug"&gt;They didnâ€™t have the budget for that kind of thing at first. Give them time, theyâ€™ve got to keep ramping up the atrocity-meter somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOdjYC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So thereâ€™s spine-ripping. That sounds pretty over-the top. Is this movie fun?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mcjeg0"&gt;It really should be, but it mostly isnâ€™t. The vampires-vs.-werewolves concept is pulpy and comes with a slight tinge of gleeful camp, but everyone onscreen seems to be miserable and glowering at all times. Lara Pulver, who played Irene Adler on &lt;em&gt;Sherlock&lt;/em&gt;, at least appears to be enjoying herself as new character Semira, an up-and-coming vampire council member whose hobbies include wearing improbably revealing clothing and bullying her pouty boy-toy Varga (&lt;em&gt;Damien&lt;/em&gt; star Bradley James). Also amassing power, and cradling giant blood-goblets while giving speeches about power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbUAMt"&gt;But the story mostly centers on Selene suffering like the most angsty grim-and-gritty superhero Frank Miller ever wrote. She lost her mortal family, she lost her lover, she lost her vampire father-figure, she lost her clan standing and her purpose for living, and she never lets the film forget it. This time around, sheâ€™s suffering because she had to leave her hybrid vamp-wolf daughter Eve behind forever, because everyone wants to find Eve and steal her magic blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puF6gU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herâ€¦ magic blood?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0UdpI"&gt;Yeah, donâ€™t get me started. Like I said, bloodlines are incredibly important in the &lt;em&gt;Underworld &lt;/em&gt;movies, but thatâ€™s mostly because blood has all kinds of powers. Vampires can drink peopleâ€™s blood and experience their memories. Vampires and lycans both have a common ancestor with a blood mutation, and vamps like Selene with a direct bloodline back to him get extra powers. And the lycans believe Eveâ€™s blood will make them super-powerful because reasons. They donâ€™t really get into the reasons, but they sure do harp on Eve a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iQVhh6V4WHTTWnCHigDtpJiLyfc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7766395/SeleneSoSad.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screen Gems&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KXHUvH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But câ€™mon, vampires and werewolves fighting. Thatâ€™s gotta be kinda fun, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDvxpN"&gt;It was in the first movie, but itâ€™s gotten pretty samey, frankly, which may explain why this movie has so much more vampire intrigue than vamp-wolf combat. The CGI werewolves still look really cheap and ugly, which has always been a problem with the series, and the combat tends to be either an eye-hurting blur or a bunch of Zack Snyder-friendly leaps between slo-mo and quicktime. The martial-arts faceoffs do tend to be more rah-rah exciting, but the gunfights are just a lot of blood-splatter and bodies hitting the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhXegO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So who are these movies for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuUTn2"&gt;Role-players who loved &lt;em&gt;Vampire: The Masquerade &lt;/em&gt;(and its million multimedia offshoots) and canâ€™t get enough vampire political discourse and angry werewolf slavering. Longtime &lt;em&gt;Underworld &lt;/em&gt;series fans, for whom this has become a soap opera punctuated by violence: everyoneâ€™s always harping on who did what to who years ago, thereâ€™s a lot of hammy bad-guy scheming, and occasionally two poor doomed characters will hook up under unlikely circumstances. Unfortunately, sex in this series is usually about as fatal as it is in slasher movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NRz18n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this a good place to enter the series?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qC4Gg"&gt;Mostly no, because of all the backstory. That said,&lt;a href="http://www.fandango.com/movie-news/retracing-the-bloodline-an-underworld-character-guide-751731"&gt; a good character guide&lt;/a&gt; will cover most of the basics, and the characters helpfully stop every 10 minutes to remind the audience about Eveâ€™s magic blood, or about the crimes that got Selene exiled. Or they just restate their relationships to each other for anyone whoâ€™s feeling lost. This is one of the things that make the movie kind of a drag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6YRlz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else makes the movie a drag?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVEBn3"&gt;Well, this is really a complaint about the whole franchise, but everything in this movie is so damn dim. Vampires canâ€™t stand sunlight, so it makes sense that the vampire scenes would all look like David Fincher lit them with the same 20-watt bulb heâ€™s been using since &lt;em&gt;Fight Club&lt;/em&gt;. But thereâ€™s no clear reason why the lycans also like to operate in grimy bleak underlit environments. The entire film has the same blue-and-black color palette, and it gets really samey and visually dreary. It means visibility in a lot of scenes is pretty poor. It also means the entire franchise feels like itâ€™s stuck in a grubby goth-grunge, post-Nine Inch Nails era that felt wearily dated three movies ago. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rr5y_oPFRRjWens6M4z5a-sGUUA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7766409/DavidGrimdark.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screen Gems&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xbnaCY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But does this film forward the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underworld&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; story? Does it add anything new?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKNlKI"&gt;Sure. It adds that faction of Daenerys Targaryen vampires, who live in the frozen north somewhere, and who have a special connection to the Sacred World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwIpTN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theâ€¦ what now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjrlrX"&gt;Yeah, I know. The Sacred World is to &lt;em&gt;Underworld: Blood Wars &lt;/em&gt;what the magic future-predicting loom was to &lt;em&gt;Wanted&lt;/em&gt;. Itâ€™s a great big question mark thatâ€™s so profoundly distracting, it warps the entire movie. And then a prominent character visits the Sacred World and comes back all â€œWow, the Sacred World certainly changed me,â€ but we never actually see it, or get any explanation of what it is, or what it means, or how it changes people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuMOso"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That sounds ridiculous.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tlWROU"&gt;It really is. So is the way the film uses it as a deus ex machina, but thereâ€™s no way to get into that without spoiling significant plot points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="piQ2JN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the Sacred World thing youâ€™re hinting at the single most ridiculous moment in this movie?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9a9Cb3"&gt;Not really. The most ridiculous thing is probably the scene where vampire tough-guy David and new lycan leader Marius (Tobias Menzies) stand about three feet away from each other and empty their automatic weapons into each other, then howl angrily in each otherâ€™s faces as all the bullets pop back out of their healing bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Snhm9b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youâ€™re sure? Thatâ€™s the most ridiculous thing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AAVww0"&gt;Okay, maybe not. Maybe itâ€™s when David gets a glimpse of a new weapon appearing in a big fight, and this serious, grimdark hero, heavy with responsibility and the many complications of his eternal unlife, says â€œFuuuuuckâ€ in blurry super-slow motion as the camera zooms in on his face. Thatâ€™s actually a pretty good moment, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EhyZxXotKPVKlhJ6kNSe48tuu4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7766417/SeleneDaylight.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screen Gems&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gXwmtS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thatâ€™s your final answer? Thatâ€™s the most ridiculous thing in the film?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQKTXq"&gt;Okay, fine, itâ€™s a tie with the moment where Selene &lt;em&gt;drinks her own blood&lt;/em&gt; in order to &lt;em&gt;experience her own memories&lt;/em&gt;. In the middle of a big fight. Because thatâ€™s certainly the best time for a sensual flashback involving Scott Speedman. Why doesnâ€™t she just, yâ€™know, &lt;em&gt;remember&lt;/em&gt; those memories? It is entirely unclear. She probably wants to feel them more intensely in the moment, but itâ€™s entirely unexplained. Itâ€™s just kind of your average moment of â€œI am so mad about this fight that Iâ€™m going to take a time-out to bite myself and watch myself have sex with Scott Speedman for the win.â€&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQnCc0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have so many more questions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPlnzO"&gt;Thatâ€™s cheating the format. You get one more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5jKnI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, here it is: How many more questions will I have if I actually watch this movie?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N44KHC"&gt;Sneaky. I bet if you found a genie and it offered you three wishes, youâ€™d try that lame wishing-for-infinite-wishes thing. But we didnâ€™t start with any ground rules, so this is legal. Here are a few of the questions moviegoers can expect to walk out of &lt;em&gt;Underworld: Blood Wars &lt;/em&gt;asking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gm8HOu"&gt;Do all vampires bite themselves to re-experience their own memories? Is that the vampire equivalent of a family photo album? Seriously, what the hell is the Sacred World? Why make such a big deal out of it and then use it as a cheap get-out-of-jail-free card? Given Mariusâ€™ origin, why did he care about the vampire/werewolf war at all? Given how the last combat ends, do the filmmakers owe royalties to the makers of &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt;? How did Marius and his vampire lover get together in the first place, since the two sides can never be in the same room without trying to murder each other? Why do these movies keep returning to the vampire/werewolf romance angle when it absolutely never works out? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2iz5sg"&gt;And most of all, given that &lt;em&gt;Blood Wars &lt;/em&gt;wraps on a pregnant moment â€” not exactly a cliffhanger, but on a clear teaser for the next episode in the franchise â€” how many more of these movies will there be?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I played Battlefield on Razerâ€™s three-screen laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tLVICbVDvVLBPi7VUDxbdbncQJY=/3x0:2037x1356/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52636517/vsavov_170103_1355_0008.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="benqhk"&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/5/14112686/razer-project-valerie-multi-monitor-gaming-laptop-concept"&gt;Razer Project Valerie&lt;/a&gt; prototype is a laptop with not one, not two, but three 17-inch displays. It can run &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 1&lt;/em&gt; at 12K resolution with perfectly smooth frame rates. Thereâ€™s no price or release date, as this is far from becoming a real product, but if Razer finds enough demand from users, the company promises to build this crazy concoction for real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iBskic"&gt;I played on it, so let me tell you what thatâ€™s like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afPCqt"&gt;Razer has set brought two Project Valerie examples to CES: one that works and demonstrates the full performance but isnâ€™t particularly refined in its cosmetics, and another that has the looks down but canâ€™t be played. As such, it makes it tough to judge the final product, should there ever be one. The functional prototype has the side screens slightly ahead of the main one, whereas they should ideally sit flush with one another, either on a level plane or with the side screens titled in for a surround view effect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Project Valerie" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k5WI9U9TilprdSqsO0tpa9SaTE8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7745743/vsavov_170103_1355_0018.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Vlad Savov&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Razer Project Valerie&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KN7m6u"&gt;Even with the foregoing provisos, I got a good sense of what the Valerie provides in terms of added advantage over the "regular" 17-inch &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/20/13344566/razer-blade-pro-specs-price-release-date-photos"&gt;Razer Blade Pro&lt;/a&gt; (the laptop that this prototype is based on). When people were shooting at me in &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt;, I could reference a side screen to more accurately locate the source of the gunfire. And when I had some downtime in the game, I could admire the vistas surrounding me â€” I could imagine a slower-paced game like any of the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; series would really benefit from this extra opportunity to admire the scenery. It surely adds to the sense of immersion if you have the time to gawk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEIYSR"&gt;In a fast-paced game such as a first-person shooter, however, I find my focus is fixed firmly on the middle of the screen. Which in the case would be the middle of the middle screen, in fact. That renders the side screens almost completely irrelevant, and I almost had to force myself to look at them during moments of action in &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt;. Thatâ€™s not a super promising first taste for something that would likely cost a ridiculous amount of money, but itâ€™s very obviously a luxury. Your gaming experience and performance are not going to dramatically improve with a three-screened laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Project Valerie" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KM2NFytzasE4PCL-y8exZIXvDGo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7745767/vsavov_170103_1355_0013.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Vlad Savov&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Razer Project Valerie&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LlyYz2"&gt;Like VR, I feel like the Razer Project Valerie is wrongly targeted at gamers. This sort of setup has better potential to prove compelling to people who need to juggle a whole ton of data and visuals on screen at the same time. Laugh if you will, but this would be a killer solution for mastering all your Excel spreadsheet. Multitaskers would also rejoice about having the space for all their chat and social media channels on the side, along with a browser window or two, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; then still having a spare screen to game on, should they still yearn for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Project Valerie" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a5OfUV2N8QRJtp0m5kQgYVpi33w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7745773/vsavov_170103_1355_0008.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Vlad Savov&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Razer Project Valerie&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DXWlsP"&gt;We come to CES to soak up the tech worldâ€™s visions for the future, and this is surely one of the zaniest and most outlandish ones. I remain unsure whether Razer is serious about this or just looking to attract the biggest CES hype. But yes, Project Valerie is certainly something different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="REZogh"&gt;My main takeaway from playing &lt;em&gt;Battlefield &lt;/em&gt;on the crazy concept Razer built on top of the Razer Blade Pro? I now really want to play &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; on the original, single-screen Blade Pro. That laptop is enough of a gaming beast to satisfy all of my mobile needs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New York Cityâ€™s closest nuclear power plant may close in five years</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_38JoOND-SKJqsemVu2ISuDfYdk=/594x0:3327x1822/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52636287/Indian_Point_Nuclear_Power_Plant.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="emD71R"&gt;Earlier today, the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/nyregion/indian-point-nuclear-power-plant-shutdown.html?_r=0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that the Indian Point nuclear power plant will close by 2021. However, a spokesperson for New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that the deal is not yet finalized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unATZa"&gt;The&lt;a href="http://www.safesecurevital.com/about-us/"&gt; Indian Point Energy Center&lt;/a&gt; is home to three nuclear reactors, only two of which are active. Itâ€™s located on the edge of the Hudson river in Buchanan, New York â€” about &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Manhattan,+New+York,+NY/Buchanan,+NY+10511/@41.025945,-74.1292845,10z/am=t/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2588f046ee661:0xa0b3281fcecc08c!2m2!1d-73.9712488!2d40.7830603!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2cf57acba38ef:0xa23e350fb397f034!2m2!1d-73.9381943!2d41.2620383"&gt;an hourâ€™s drive from Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;. Government officials &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/nyregion/plan-to-expand-a-pipeline-at-indian-point-raises-concern.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FIndian%20Point%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant%20(NY)&amp;amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;amp;amp;region=stream&amp;amp;amp;module=stream_unit&amp;amp;amp;version=latest&amp;amp;amp;contentPlacement=5&amp;amp;amp;pgtype=collection"&gt;are concerned&lt;/a&gt; that if a natural disaster or terrorist attack were to damage the plant, it could devastate nearby New York City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIBv73"&gt;â€œFor years, my office has been fighting to address the serious risks posed by Indian Point to the surrounding communities and the environment,â€ New York Attorney General &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/"&gt;Eric T. Schneiderman&lt;/a&gt; said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; â€œIf we can shut-down Indian Point under an agreement that enhances public safety and kick-starts investment into safer and more reliable renewable energy sources, that will be a major victory for the millions of New Yorkers who live in the region.â€&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4jCMEQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The deal is not yet finalized&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="88YnON"&gt;The plant has three full-time inspectors on site, and a specialist inspector visits periodically to check the plantâ€™s security and radiation safety, Neil Sheehan, a public affairs officer with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc.html"&gt;Nuclear Regulatory Commission&lt;/a&gt; is the federal agency that oversees nuclear power plant safety. According to its latest safety report for the third quarter of 2016, there were no safety concerns that would warrant increasing federal oversight of the plant, Sheehan says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLSbsE"&gt;The plant is one of &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=207&amp;amp;t=3"&gt;61 power plants operating&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, and it produces more than 2000 megawatts of energy. Thatâ€™s enough for about 2 million homes, according &lt;a href="http://www.safesecurevital.com/about-us/"&gt;to its website&lt;/a&gt;. â€œThere are a number of reactors that have shut down in recent years,â€ Sheehan says. While there were a few plants closed for safety reasons, many were shuttered because of economics. â€œIn most cases it had to do with challenges in the energy markets, the low cost of natural gas being a major factor.â€ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="0QYQOp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Officials worry the plant could endanger New York City&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zo82JJ"&gt;The agreement, reported by the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, will allow the plantâ€™s owner, &lt;a href="http://entergy.com/about_entergy/"&gt;Entergy Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, to renew its license with the NRC to operate in the state. Entergyâ€™s current licenses expired in 2013 and 2015. While the NRC is the body that grants the license, the state can block that process on two fronts. One of those is the plantâ€™s water permit, which spells out how much water the plant can draw from the Hudson River to use for non-radioactive cooling purposes, Sheehan says. The other is certification under the &lt;a href="https://coast.noaa.gov/czm/consistency/"&gt;Coastal Zone Management Act&lt;/a&gt;, which allows states to determine whether federal activities could endanger the stateâ€™s coastline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtiUFy"&gt;If the state backs down on those fronts, Entergy will agree to fund environmental protection efforts to the tune of $15 million, and will set up a nearby â€œemergency operations center,â€ according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. Provided the state can find a new source of power by 2021, the reactors will be shut down by then. If the state canâ€™t find a replacement, the deadline could be extended by a few years, to 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaZSAI"&gt;Jerry Nappi, a spokesperson for Entergy, declined to comment about the agreement. Governor Cuomoâ€™s office did not reply to requests for comment. And Sheehan with the NRC said that they, too, are waiting on confirmation. Jack Temple, press secretary to the New York attorney generalâ€™s office, would not confirm the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitbit plans to launch its own app store this year</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cUTd9SHKWCIQdLa8u1_D0Phbjj8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52635089/verge-2016-09-21_14-29-06.0.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="oz3Uvb"&gt;Fitbit wants to launch its own wearable app store â€œas soon as possible,â€ the companyâ€™s co-founder and CEO James Park said in an interview at CES earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z20wRt"&gt;The new app store would be built using some of the assets Fitbit acquired from Pebble when it &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/7/13867158/fitbit-buys-pebble-smartwatch-acquisition-deal"&gt;bought the struggling wearable startup&lt;/a&gt; last month. In its five years of existence Pebble amassed around 14,000 third-party apps in its store, and Park said Pebble had â€œworked out a lot of the kinksâ€ that go into building an app store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmgK5S"&gt;Park noted that an app store would be especially helpful as Fitbit tries to extend its relationships with employers and health care companies that are using Fitbits for corporate wellness programs. Earlier this week, Fitbit said that it was partnering with UnitedHealthCare and Qualcomm to &lt;a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/05/unitedhealthcare-and-fitbit-to-pay-users-up-to-1500-to-use-devices.html"&gt;offer $1500 annual incentives to Charge 2 wearers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BrSqTe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This also means that Fitbit is almost definitely, undoubtedly, hit-us-over-the-head-with-it-why-donâ€™t-you, making a real smartwatch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nijQuE"&gt;â€œThere are so many different applications [our partners] want to write,â€ Park said, â€œfrom fitness-related ones to pill reminder applications. And we donâ€™t have the support in place for that right now, or any software infrastructure on our devices to run those apps.â€ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5FPlLY"&gt;Of course, this also means that Fitbit is almost definitely, undoubtedly, hit-us-over-the-head-with-it-why-donâ€™t-you, making a real smartwatch. Park has said in recent months that the company is exploring new form factors this year. Fitbit also bought Coin last year with the intention of building payment capabilities into its wearables, and then it bought Pebble. The Fitbit Blaze, which was announce at CES last year, came &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt; to being a smartwatch in terms of its design, but was marketed as a smart fitness watch and didnâ€™t support third party apps.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zoAlep"&gt;Park wouldnâ€™t say exactly when the app store will launch, just that it would be â€œas soon as possible.â€ He also said there are wearable apps he personally wants to develop for Fitbit in his free time, because tech company CEOâ€™s do love to spend their nonexistent free time &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/29/12691608/mark-zuckerberg-artificial-intelligence-smart-house-demo"&gt;doing more work&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="U9vazK"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pBS8Ey"&gt;Which Fitbit should you buy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="2NywZu"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Which Fitbit should you buy?|23458" data-volume-uuid="1215ff8cd" data-volume-id="23458" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-394" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U3cng4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZkJU2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5APbM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deadpool's Golden Globe nominations are just the cherry on top for Fox</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jx5Pf1ah6Qoh3GJ8Q4vKlS4VRk0=/0x0:1614x1076/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52634821/deadpool-fox-marvel_01.0.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="UAksBk"&gt;The Golden Globes are this Sunday, meaning mainstream audiences will be getting their first look at what movies and TV shows &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/8/10734186/nomineering-week-1-golden-globes-are-bullshit"&gt;the Hollywood Foreign Press thinks mattered the most&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. You have your usual fare, of course: awards-baiting dramas ranging from &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/8/13836786/casey-affleck-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-oscars-woody-allen"&gt;cynical&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/9/15/12928752/moonlight-movie-review-barry-jenkins-tiff-2016"&gt;groundbreaking&lt;/a&gt;; comedies that &lt;a href="http://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/20th-century-women-review-new-york-film-festival-1201879299/"&gt;shine more for their storied leading ladies&lt;/a&gt;; and performances that go from good to &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/17/11686442/the-lobster-movie-review-colin-farrell-rachel-weisz"&gt;kind of freaky&lt;/a&gt;. And then you have &lt;em&gt;Deadpool&lt;/em&gt;. The first live-action superhero movie to pick up a Golden Globe nomination for Best Comedy or Musical, the film also earned star Ryan Reynolds a Best Actor nomination. Itâ€™s a dream come true for comic book movie fans looking for recognition for the genre that birthed &lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;/em&gt;. And the best part? Both nods are deserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FtRJ2Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;â€˜Deadpoolâ€™ probably wonâ€™t win, but thatâ€™s okay&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KgcXTY"&gt;Barring some upset, though, &lt;em&gt;Deadpool &lt;/em&gt;probably wonâ€™t win. The film faces some stiff competition, and &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/17/11686442/the-lobster-movie-review-colin-farrell-rachel-weisz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;La La Land&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is the odds-on favorite to win in both categories. (Ryan Reynolds is great, but his turn just doesnâ€™t have the momentum Ryan Goslingâ€™s performance has.) But thatâ€™s okay! Getting a nomination is a big accomplishment, even for something as relatively inconsequential as the Golden Globes, and it speaks to just how important it was that &lt;em&gt;Deadpool &lt;/em&gt;differed so much from its competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAuHrl"&gt;While not the greatest superhero movie of all time, &lt;em&gt;Deadpool &lt;/em&gt;was a genuinely good film with a unique point of view in the ever-expanding pantheon of comics cinema. Reynolds delivered one of the most talked-about performances of the year, and the filmâ€™s mix of violence and comedy sent a gleeful â€œFuck you!â€ to a film genre some fans and critics have grown tired of. In short, it stood out, and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association took notice. Even though 2016 was a big year for genre properties, &lt;em&gt;Deadpool &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.polygon.com/2016/12/13/13937246/deadpool-golden-globe-nomination-ryan-reynolds"&gt;felt more like a subversive comedy than a superhero movie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLWDOd"&gt;It also helps that it was almost impossible to ignore the movie, and both Reynolds and 20th Century Fox did some daring things to get people to take notice of a film that had no reason to succeed â€” let alone become a critical and commercial success. Blame it on Deadpoolâ€™s ability to break the fourth wall: the Merc with a Mouth appeared in everything from conventional billboards to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsdD1MJXOpk"&gt;testicular cancer PSAs&lt;/a&gt;. Moviegoers certainly took notice, catapulting the film to $780 million worldwide at the box office, but awards voters took notice, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBxE93"&gt;It all lead to &lt;em&gt;Deadpool &lt;/em&gt;being the superhero film that was most commonly on the average moviegoerâ€™s lips despite coming out in a year that was positively bursting with competition. &lt;em&gt;X-Men: Apocalypse&lt;/em&gt; was a forgettable failure. &lt;em&gt;Batman v Superman &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad &lt;/em&gt;were eviscerated by critics. Even &lt;em&gt;Captain America: Civil War &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt;, generally praised when released, quickly faded from memory. &lt;em&gt;Deadpool &lt;/em&gt;never did, and in that way it was easy to see how it had won 2016. Now, the Merc with a Mouth is &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/30/13471768/deadpool-20th-century-fox-marvel-superhero-movie-strategy"&gt;getting a sequel&lt;/a&gt; that may push the envelope even further â€” and he may win 2018 as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="PHx4Ta"&gt;&lt;q&gt;By virtue of being so different, â€˜Deadpoolâ€™ basically won 2016&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xkEMRl"&gt;In the end, the Golden Globe nominations, as lame as they may be, are further proof that the experiment worked. 20th Century Fox managed to make a good movie that challenged established convention in its genre, got people excited, and couldnâ€™t be ignored. No one would have been surprised if &lt;em&gt;Deadpool &lt;/em&gt;didnâ€™t get a nomination. Itâ€™s not like superhero movies ever get them, and better films and performances are snubbed every year. But thatâ€™s precisely why the fact that itâ€™s up for an award this Sunday is so &lt;em&gt;Deadpool&lt;/em&gt;-ian in the first place. Leave it to a movie that succeeded by breaking all the rules to upend the unwritten bylaws of awards season as its final act.&lt;/p&gt;
