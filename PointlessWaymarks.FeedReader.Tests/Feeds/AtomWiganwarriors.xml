<h3 id="wigan-warriors-have-linked-with-rugby-league-ireland-in-a-partnership-with-community-club-loughshinny-rlfc">Wigan Warriors have linked with Rugby League Ireland in a partnership with Community Club Loughshinny RLFC.</h3>



<p>Wigan Warriors Community Foundation are starting to deliver Rugby League in Ireland in a bid to increase participation within the game over the water. Staff from the Community Foundation recently visited Loughshinny, a coastal village in northern County Dublin, the first Community Club in Ireland to become part of the ambassador project.</p>



<p>Head of the Community Foundation,¬†Martin McLoughlin,¬†said: ‚ÄúWorking with Ireland RL and¬†Loughshinny¬†RLFC is another powerful statement of the aspirations of Wigan Warriors and its¬†Community¬†Foundation. We¬†hope to generate a positive presence, profile and brand through strategic delivery in areas of potential growth. If we can provide schools and clubs with the fundamentals to increase community engagement it allows us to reach out to new fans and new participants.‚Äù¬†</p>



<p>During the visit they attended schools and the local&nbsp;Rugby&nbsp;League&nbsp;Clubs&nbsp;facilities to share future partnership plans that will see Wigan Warriors coaches deliver&nbsp;Rugby&nbsp;League through a host of fun school holiday camps,&nbsp;development day performance sessions and coach education workshops for all teachers and coaches.‚ÄØ&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wigan&nbsp;Warriors community club&nbsp;ambassadors programme&nbsp;is fully committed to supporting all 21 local community clubs that are involved in the new 2022 program and any other clubs that have an interest to be involved and seek professional support with&nbsp;their&nbsp;club‚Äôs future development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This new and exciting partnership will complement those efforts and support the growth of the grassroots game and also give young aspiring rugby players a clear pathway with Wigan Warriors.&nbsp;The&nbsp;visit was the first of many to Ireland that will engage with so many Irish rugby league enthusiasts &amp; in return we&nbsp;are looking&nbsp;forward to welcoming&nbsp;Loughshinny&nbsp;and Ireland&nbsp;Rugby&nbsp;League to a Wigan Warriors home fixture in 2022.‚ÄØ&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rory O&#8217;Hara of Loughshinny RL said: ‚ÄúLoughshinny&nbsp;Rugby League Club and&nbsp;St&nbsp;Brendan‚Äôs&nbsp;School&nbsp;Rugby&nbsp;League were delighted to host Wigan Warriors.&nbsp;This partnership strengthens Wigan‚Äôs&nbsp;connection with our Irish fans not just in Ireland but with the wider Irish&nbsp;Rugby&nbsp;League diasporas around the world particularly in Australia and New Zealand,&nbsp;while also providing a clear pathway for young Irish players both in&nbsp;Loughshinny&nbsp;and in Ireland as a whole to participate in&nbsp;Rugby&nbsp;League and take up all the advantages and knowledge that being an ambassador to the Wigan&nbsp;Warriors entails!‚Äù</p>



<p>In addition, Chairman of Rugby League Ireland, Jim Reynolds, said: </p>



<p>‚ÄúI am delighted that Wigan Warriors have chosen to bring this first-in-Ireland partnership between a local Club for junior RL players and coaches directly into their outstanding Ambassador programme ‚Äì their first outside of England.‚ÄØ&nbsp;</p>



<p>Growing Junior RL is one of the major pillars of the RLI Five Year Strategic Plan, that we launched three months ago, to build and sustain our great sport in Ireland for the decades to come.‚ÄØCongratulations‚ÄØto all involved!‚Äù&nbsp;</p>

<p>‚ÄúNice little 10-day break over Christmas but it‚Äôs good to be back now with the boys. Everyone has had a nice break but everyone was very keen and eager to get back,‚Äù he said.</p>



<p>‚ÄúI spent Christmas with my family and friends, spent some time with my friends back at home which was nice but now I‚Äôm back over in Wigan and looking forward to kicking on with my Rugby.‚Äù</p>



<p>The squad all returned from the Christmas break and have two pre-season fixtures on the horizon: ‚ÄúYeah that‚Äôs the good thing about coming back after Christmas, you‚Äôve got the games to look forward to, we‚Äôve only got a few weeks worth of training and then we‚Äôre into the games which everyone is buzzing for, I can‚Äôt wait to get back out there with the lads.‚Äù</p>

<p>Smithies is well accustomed to Matt Peet as a Coach and has enjoyed his approach so far: ‚ÄúFrom playing at Scholarship I always thought Matt would one day get Head Coach at Wigan, Matt has had a big influence on my career and I‚Äôm chuffed for him getting the Head Coach role. I think he fully deserves it and I think he‚Äôll do well.<br><br>&#8220;I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs been a big culture change, about what we do away from the training ground, about what we do inside these four walls, just being better blokes and more importantly just back enjoying our rugby I think. It‚Äôs been really good so far.‚Äù</p>



<p>Smithies enters another season with the Warriors and has high hopes to improve his game:  ‚Äú100%, I‚Äôm 21 now and I‚Äôve got over 50 games under my belt so I think this year I really need to kick on. I‚Äôm not really a young lad anymore so I think I need to start showing that on the pitch.<br><br>‚ÄúThe past two seasons have been a bit average, my first season was alright then after that it‚Äôs just been a bit average but this year I‚Äôm really looking forward to kicking on with my rugby.‚Äù</p>



<p><strong>Make it Wigan in 2022 and celebrate our 150th year with a Wigan Warriors season ticket. Supporting Wigan is about more than just going to a game.

<h3 id="wigan-warriors-can-confirm-that-youngsters-alex-sutton-and-matty-nicholson-have-both-signed-for-betfred-championship-side-newcastle-thunder-on-loan-deals">Wigan Warriors can confirm that youngsters Alex Sutton and Matty Nicholson have both signed for Betfred Championship side Newcastle Thunder on loan deals.</h3>



<p>Sutton, 19, and Nicholson, 18, were both given senior squad numbers with Wigan for the first time in the off-season and have now joined Newcastle to gain first team experience. </p>



<p>There is a call-back option in Wigan&#8217;s favour for both players to return to the Club throughout 2022 if required. </p>



<p>Head of Youth, Darrell Goulding, said: &#8220;It‚Äôs a really good experience for them getting to play at a high level in the Championship and will help accelerate their development. Newcastle have a very good set up and will make the lads feel welcome. We look forward to watching them progress.&#8221;</p>



<p>Both players have been involved in the Warriors&#8217; pre-season preparations ahead of the loan agreement. </p>



<p>Sutton joined Wigan&#8217;s Scholarship system having started playing Rugby League with Widnes Moorfield. He has since progressed through the Academy and featured heavily for the Warriors&#8217; Under-19s team in 2021. </p>



<p>On making the move to Newcastle, Sutton said: &#8220;I‚Äôm looking forward to being at Thunder and working hard to keep getting experience. I‚Äôve been introduced to the first team at Wigan this year and have been involved in pre-season, but I‚Äôm coming on loan to hopefully gain some experience.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nicholson returns to Thunder having played for the North East side in a game against Bradford Bulls in August 2021 on a short-term deal. </p>



<p>The second rower / loose forward started his Rugby League journey at Siddal ARLFC and went on to join Wigan&#8217;s Scholarship programme aged 14. Progressing through the Academy ranks, Nicholson was named the Warriors Under-16s Player of the Year in 2019 and has been a key player for the Under-19s side. </p>



<p>&#8220;Coming back on loan to Thunder will hopefully give me an opportunity to play a good standard of rugby consistently to keep trying on improving my game,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was here for one game last season and the boys were a good set of lads to be around. It was a big step up from playing Academy Rugby League but it was a good experience that I enjoyed and I‚Äôm hoping to be able to get more of that this season.&#8221;</p>

<p>England Women Head Coach Craig Richards said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really pleased to have named our first National Performance Squad in a World Cup year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>‚ÄúThe majority of the players included have been in or around the programme for some time now and I feel we have some real quality amongst the squad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great to have been able to add Keara Bennett to the squad after she consistently performed for Leeds throughout 2021.&nbsp;We had several international debutants last season and there&nbsp;are certainly going to be opportunities for players to break into the side before the World Cup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been building towards this World Cup for a number of years now, but we know how crucial our preparations over the next nine months are going to be.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>



<p>England Women will begin their Rugby League World Cup campaign against Brazil at Headingley Stadium on Tuesday 1 November. A clash with Canada at Wigan‚Äôs DW Stadium on Saturday 5 November is followed by a final group stage fixture back in Leeds against Papua New Guinea on Wednesday 9 November.</p>



<p>The RFL are looking to finalise a mid-season international programme which will see England Women take to the field before this year‚Äôs Rugby League World Cup</p>



<p><strong>England Women National Performance Squad</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dannielle Anderson (Leeds Rhinos)&nbsp;<br>Savannah Andrade (York City Knights)&nbsp;<br>Caitlin Beevers (Leeds Rhinos)&nbsp;<br>Keara Bennett (Leeds Rhinos)&nbsp;<br>Leah Burke (St Helens)&nbsp;<br>Chantelle&nbsp;Crowl&nbsp;(St Helens)&nbsp;<br>Jodie Cunningham (St Helens)&nbsp;<br>Hollie Dodd (York City Knights)&nbsp;<br>Grace Field (York City Knights)&nbsp;<br>Kelsey Gentles (York City Knights)&nbsp;<br>Fran&nbsp;Goldthorp&nbsp;(Leeds Rhinos)&nbsp;<br><strong>Rebecca Greenfield (Wigan Warriors)&nbsp;</strong><br>Amy&nbsp;Hardcastle (St Helens)&nbsp;<br>Shona Hoyle (Huddersfield Giants)&nbsp;<br>Amy Johnson (Leeds Rhinos)&nbsp;<br>Tara Jones (St Helens)&nbsp;<br>Chloe Kerrigan (Leeds Rhinos)&nbsp;<br>Emma Lumley (Leeds Rhinos)&nbsp;<br><strong>Vicky Molyneux (Wigan Warriors)&nbsp;</strong><br>Carrie Roberts (St Helens)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Georgia Roche (Leeds Rhinos)&nbsp;<br>Emily Rudge (St Helens)&nbsp;<br>Tara Stanley (York City Knights)&nbsp;<br>Beth Stott (St Helens)&nbsp;<br><strong>Rachel Thompson (Wigan Warriors)&nbsp;</strong><br>Paige Travis (St Helens)&nbsp;<br>Vicky Whitfield (St Helens)&nbsp;<br>Naomi Williams (St Helens)&nbsp;<br><strong>Georgia Wilson (Wigan Warriors)&nbsp;</strong><br>Olivia Wood (York City Knights)&nbsp;<br>Rachael&nbsp;Woosey&nbsp;(St Helens)</p>

<ul><li><strong>Brad Singleton gives an update on the pre-season schedule as the Warriors gear up for the 2022 season.</strong></li><li><strong>Singleton: &#8220;I want us to be in a position where we can go and do some good stuff, and I want to be heavily involved in that.‚Äù</strong></li><li><strong>Hear more from Brad Singleton on Wigan TV, available <a href="http://wwrl.net/tv">HERE</a>.</strong></li></ul>



<h3 id="brad-singleton-talks-pre-season-the-mood-in-camp-new-faces-and-personal-aims-for-2022-as-he-caught-up-with-wigan-tv">Brad Singleton talks pre-season, the mood in camp, new faces and personal aims for 2022 as he caught up with Wigan TV.</h3>



<p>Singleton said: ‚ÄúI think the lads have been great, we‚Äôve all been waiting for it, ready to rip in. Obviously pre-season is a tough time, it‚Äôs enjoyable but also has it‚Äôs tough moments but with it being after Christmas you know the games are around the corner. You see others playing the Boxing Day friendly, see other people playing on Sundays and you get the itch again. The sooner it comes around, the better.‚Äù</p>



<p>The forward is in double figures for pre-season schedules but he admits it&#8217;s all about building the foundations: ‚ÄúIt comes around quick, I think this is my 12<sup>th</sup> pre-season full time in Super League so it does come around quick. No matter when you start, whether it‚Äôs October, November, December, once you get that slot it comes around rapid and before you know it, it‚Äôll be Round 10.</p>



<p>‚ÄúFor us, and for me personally it‚Äôs about hitting the ground running, nailing the friendlies ‚Äì that‚Äôs not saying wiping the floor with any team, it‚Äôs about ticking the right boxes and building the right foundations for a good year.‚Äù</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Brad-Singleton4-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7948" srcset="https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Brad-Singleton4-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Brad-Singleton4-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Brad-Singleton4-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Brad-Singleton4-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Brad-Singleton4-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>He added: ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre in a good place, we can‚Äôt win anything in pre-season but I think you can lose a season in pre-season, I can definitely say that hasn‚Äôt been done. This pre-season has set some good foundations, Matt [Peet] is a very smart bloke, he‚Äôs very respected within the camp and he‚Äôs got a hold of this group. He‚Äôs driving this culture, it‚Äôs working and everyone is buying in, for me that is everything.<br><br>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to wait and see, I‚Äôm not going to say where we‚Äôll be at the end but we‚Äôll hopefully be capable for the big games.‚Äú</p>



<p>Singleton had plenty of praise for some of the new faces in the camp, as well as those who are familiar faces: ‚Äú[Patrick] Mago, [Kaide] Ellis and [Cade] Cust they‚Äôve all been great, they‚Äôve complimented the group. I think Mago and Ellis will bring something, there‚Äôs some physicality there, they‚Äôll bring something good and it will compliment our pack. The end game will be long, no matter what the competition for places, it‚Äôs great to have a little bit more experience in the pack, it‚Äôll benefit us all.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWith all the young lads or those who have got three, four, five seasons deep, it‚Äôll be good to see how they go. They‚Äôve got the experience now, they‚Äôve had the hurt and stuff like that which drives you, hopefully, the end product is great.‚Äù </p>



<p>The forward finished by laying down his aims for 2022: ‚ÄúFor me personally it‚Äôs about enjoying it, enjoying the ride. Obviously a few years ago I went through the stuff with Toronto and it‚Äôs just remembering and being grateful for where I am. I am doing that but also on the back of that I also want to be one of the most consistent forwards out there, that‚Äôll be my aim. I want us to be in a position where we can go and do some good stuff, and I want to be heavily involved in that.‚Äù</p>
