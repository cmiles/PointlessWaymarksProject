It’s certainly been an eventful year for StarCraft, and now that the season has ended, it’s time to continue forward with our post-BlizzCon design and balance changes. Thanks to everyone for testing; your feedback has helped us iterate and make many improvements. Before the changes go live, we have a few more updates we’d like to add in:
<p/>

<h2><strong>Terran</strong></h2>

<h3>Cyclone</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Cyclone supply cost reduced from 4 to 3.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>When the Cyclone had its Vespene Gas cost reduced in a patch prior to 3.8, and we also increased its supply out of caution against mass Cyclones becoming too prevalent at the time. More recently, we have gotten some high-level feedback that this Cyclone could perhaps be too weak due to how the meta has developed. In addition, when we first announced our pre-3.8 Cyclone revert, we emphasized our intention to have them scale better into the late-game. Thus, to improve the Cyclone’s mid- and late-game potential, we are reducing the supply cost, so they can hopefully be more easily utilized as support units in a larger army.</p>

<h3>Thor</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Thor 250mm Punisher Cannon damage increased from 40 (+10 Massive) to 40 (+15 Massive).</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Thor 250mm Punisher Cannon attack period decreased from 1.78 to 1.71.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>When we initially announced our balance revamp this year, we stated that we wanted to push the Thor into a “giant that slays other giants” role, but we haven’t heard much discussion regarding this new focus. In addition, with the recent Carrier damage revert and the Thor’s now lower armor, Thors are not able to fulfill this role as well as we’d like. Thus, we’ve carefully tweaked the numbers on the Thor’s anti-Massive weapon so that it will consistently defeat Carriers in one-on-one combat and be more powerful against the new fast-moving Tempests. At the same time, we were cautious to not critically affect its relationship against Brood Lords. As with many of our other changes in this patch, we want new options to feel powerful out of the gate, but we are also ready to readjust as necessary.</p>

<h3>Sensor Tower</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Sensor Tower pre-placement selection display will now show a range indicator on the minimap. </strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This quality of life change, which was suggested by the community, will allow players to more strategically and deliberately place their Sensor Towers.</p>

<h2><strong>Zerg</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Creep</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Creep spread delay from Hatcheries, Lairs, and Hives decreased from 0.45 to 0.3.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We received feedback that the previously proposed creep spread rate change for Hatcheries would overly adversely affect Zerg early-game, especially in ZvZ. We agree with this feedback and, as a result, will be changing the Hatchery, Lair, and Hive to retain their old creep spread rate values. Meanwhile the other creep generators (Nydus Worm, Overlords, and Creep Tumors) will remain at 0.45.</p>

<h3>Ultralisk</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Ultralisk Anabolic Synthesis upgrade research time reduced from 79 seconds to 43 seconds.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>As a Hive-level unit, Ultralisks are already locked to the late-game and having both of its upgrades require a 79 second research time could excessively delay the Ultralisk’s full power. A reduction in research time could also create more of a choice for Zerg players depending on the game state as currently, Chitinous Plating is heavily preferred as the first pick.</p>

<h2><strong>Protoss</strong></h2>

<h3>Structures</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Robotics Facility cost reverted from 150/100 to 200/100.  </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Robotics Bay cost reduced from 200/200 to 150/150.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We initially proposed reducing the mineral cost of the Robotics Facility for a variety of reasons. Two of these reasons include improving defense against Zerg in the mid-game and improving defense against Terran proxies. Since our initial proposal, however, we’ve made additional adjustments to the balance test mod such that we no longer believe Protoss needs additional help in these regards.</p>

<p>Another goal of the Robotics Facility cost change was to promote more Robotics-based openers, but we now believe a different change could be more targeted to achieve this goal. By reducing the cost of the Robotics Bay instead, we would promote deeper tech options that aren’t as common right now,such as Colossus, Disruptor, or speed-upgraded Warp Prism openers. This contrasts with the originally proposed Robotics Facility change, which we believe would have undesirably further reinforced the strength of Immortals in PvZ.</p>

<p/>

<p>We are planning to push the balance changes to live ladder at the start of the next season on Tuesday, November 20<sup>th</sup>.  However, the SCV single-click priority change will require a patch, so we will be pushing out this change a little earlier with the SC2.4.7 release.</p>

<p>Thank you for all the support and feedback, and as always, let us know what you think!  See you on ladder!</p>

<p/>

For the next StarCraft II Versus season, we’re removing <strong>Acid Plant, Dreamcatcher, Lost and Found, and Fracture</strong>. Below you will find the new 1v1 maps we’re adding, as well as the new team maps.</p>

<p/>

<h2>1v1</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/5F5QP2CF384J1541448578533.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/WRKLPSPKCM1J1541448578451.png" style="width: 700px; height: 297px;"/></a></strong></p>

<p>On this abandoned wing of the Purifier starship, you find yourself in close quarters with your enemy. Thanks to the watchtowers, gold bases, and a hidden path to the main bases, there is plenty to fight for from start to finish.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/18IUSURURN9C1541448577777.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/YD936YXQYNY61541448577724.png" style="width: 700px; height: 297px;"/></a></strong></p>

<p>This map features main bases that are relatively close together by air, but the expansions are less vulnerable to harassment.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/8CFDQEBHJ8C01541448578170.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/7YEY9SM7EI481541448577877.png" style="width: 700px; height: 297px;"/></a></p>

<p>Be ready when push comes to shove, because the rush distance on this map is very short. There are also alternate paths and no watchtowers to assist in scouting.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/JUK1P1JICJP81541448578358.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/DQPRCDSG0O161541448578201.png" style="width: 700px; height: 297px;"/></a></p>

<p>This is a large macro map, and it has a long rush distance between the main bases.  The main start locations are vulnerable to air attacks if the enemy sneaks along the edges of the map.</p>

<p/>

<h2>2v2</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/IQP4KL4QM6EV1541448577889.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/8LRT9OZ8R8ZB1541448577745.png" style="width: 700px; height: 297px;"/></a></p>

<p>Emerald City is a large macro map. Two players should defend the single wide entrance. Natural expansions have two chokepoints, splitting rush paths and expansion patterns. Gold bases can be taken as third expansions for aggressive plays.</p>

<p/>

<h2>3v3</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/6AQIOQ1ZJKGB1541448578680.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/NQFFZJ8SUFYX1541448578535.png" style="width: 700px; height: 297px;"/></a></p>

<p>Each team has a single main base, followed by a single natural expansion with a ramp to defend it. Pathways and expansions are similar to those in traditional 1v1 maps, and a Xel'naga tower is in each corner.</p>

<p/>

<h2>4v4</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/ECRK91W2JUV51541448578231.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/CXQGBIHDDLG31541448578104.png" style="width: 700px; height: 297px;"/></a></p>

<div>
<p>Two pairs of allies spawn together with their main bases connected by a backdoor path they can both use to reinforce each other. Both bases open into a shared defensive area with two chokepoints. Two potential third bases are located nearby, while additional expansions require moving towards the edges of the map.</p>

<hr/></div>

<p>Your final list for Season 4, 2018 will be:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Blueshift LE</li>
	<li>Para Site LE</li>
	<li>Cerulean Fall LE</li>
	<li>Kairos Junction LE</li>
	<li>Automaton LE</li>
	<li>Port Aleksander LE</li>
	<li>Stasis LE</li>
</ul>

<p/>

<p>The Season 4 maps are now available for testing under the Custom tab, so jump in and start practicing strategies before the new season begins on November 20. GLHF!</p>

If it were a person, it would be in college, or out working a job, trying to find its feet—it would be a time of life in which big change is nigh inevitable.</p>

<p>Here at BlizzCon 2018, in front of a standing-room only crowd that needed to be capped by venue security, StarCraft went through a transition: for the first time in its history, a non-Korean won a global final event. Joona "Serral" Sotala, the soft-spoken, trilby-wearing Finnish Zerg, won the WCS Global Finals.</p>

<p><img alt="DSC_1815.jpg" data-id="22702516" src="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/7j/7J2U7FOVK0451541302491946.jpg"/></p>

<p>The most engaging plotlines are those with twists. How sure we all were at the beginning of BlizzCon—how perfect!—how the stars had aligned for the perfect match between Serral and Terran player Cho "Maru" Seong Ju. Both dominated their respective circuits throughout 2018, winning every event they participated in, setting the stage for a symmetrical showdown.<br/>
Of course, that dream was squashed after Maru went down in a quick 3-0 loss early on BlizzCon 2018's opening day.</p>

<p>Then a new dream emerged: as Saturday shaped up, all of a sudden we were faced with a rematch of this year's GSL vs. The World, which Serral had closed out in a nailbiting 4-3 win over Kim "Stats" Dae Yeob. It was the perfect outcome we never knew we wanted—until we had it.</p>

<p>Serral drew ahead early in the best-of-seven Grand Finals, racking up three wins with insane defense and the patient death-by-a-thousand-cuts style for which he is known, loved, and feared. As the crowd in front of the stage swelled to maximum capacity, expecting a clean 4-0, Stats—who is known as one of the most well-rounded, consistent, best Protoss players in the world—showed the crowd that their hero could bleed, taking two games in a row.</p>

<p><img alt="20181103_Helena-Kristiansson_BlizzconSC2_03880.jpg" data-id="22699720" src="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/91G6DPB1ZJAD1541302444286.jpg"/></p>

<p>“I was a bit annoyed, I was a bit mad at myself,” Serral said. “I think I did some dumb mistakes. But otherwise, it didn’t faze me too much.”</p>

<p>The next game became an air vs. air battle that had viewers on the edge of their seats. Although Stats’ army appeared dominant, Serral poked and prodded at the South Korean’s economy, slowly suffocating him while showing masterful control of his air forces. As Stats typed out his final “gg," the capacity crowd erupted, shaking the walls of the Anaheim Convention Center.</p>

<p>After the match, Serral was swarmed by press, taking photos of him holding the trophy, firing questions at him. When it was all over, I asked him if it was a lot to deal with after winning something so huge.</p>

<p>“It feels good to win the whole event and make history while doing it,” he said, smiling. “Feels incredible, [but] it hasn’t sunk in yet."</p>

<p>It was a journey years in the making. In 2015, Serral could barely make it into the round of 32 at WCS events. It’s taken years to get to this point, but he never gave up. “I have always loved StarCraft, and that’s why I keep playing it,” Serral said. “In the last year, I ended high school and I’ve been building my skill level. This year, I managed to get very good and consistent.”</p>

<p><img alt="DSC_2010.jpg" data-id="22702515" src="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/TP5WQM28WAPH1541302451765.jpg"/></p>

<p>As for Serral's future? He’s not going anywhere. “I want to keep playing, go for all the titles I can try to get,” he said. “I don’t think I’m going to stop or slow down at all.”</p>

<p>Everything grows up: games, communities, passions, and people. StarCraft has been, and will be for many years to come, an expression of the best in us. Esports wouldn’t be where it is today without StarCraft—many of our lives would not be where they are today without StarCraft—and the result of the WCS Global Finals showed us that with persistence, a good mentality, and friends who support you, nothing is really impossible.</p>

<h2>Deepmind</h2>

<p>We also go an update from DeepMind on the progress they’ve made since the StarCraft II API was released. They’ve been excited to see so many members of the AI community taking an interest in their project.</p>

<p>DeepMind has been hard at work training their AI (or agent) to better understand StarCraft II. Once it started to grasp the basic rules of the game, it started exhibiting amusing behavior such as immediately worker rushing its opponent, which actually had a success rate of 50% against the 'Insane' difficulty standard StarCraft II AI!</p>

<p>After feeding the agent replays from real players, it started to execute standard macro-focused strategies, as well as defend against aggressive tactics such as cannon rushes.</p>

<div>
<p>DeepMind concluded the panel by stating they are still very focused on their research and hope to share more of their findings soon.</p>

</div>

<h2>Playstyle</h2>

<p>Zeratul’s gameplay will revolve heavily around the Prophetic Vision ability, which allows the player to discover three Xel’Naga Artifact Fragments on the map. Players are encouraged to seek out these Artifact Fragments as they will improve Zeratul in a variety of ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Zeratul, his units, calldowns, defensive structures, and even Probes will gain weapon, armor, and shield upgrades with each Artifact Fragment.</li>
	<li>Zeratul has no traditional researchable abilities. Instead, Artifact Fragments he finds will grant his units Artifact Enhancements, which are either new abilities or improvements to existing abilities.</li>
	<li>Zeratul has a potential of four top-bar abilities, but only one is unlocked at the start of the game. Players unlock new top-bar abilities with each Artifact Fragment they find.</li>
	<li>The Legendary Legion calldowns improve with each Artifact Fragment found.</li>
	<li>Zeratul himself gains bonuses.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, uniquely among Commanders, Zeratul’s top-bar will be fully customizable. Both at the start of the game and with each Artifact Fragment recovered, you’ll be able to choose one additional top-bar ability from a selection of two or three. Players should select these abilities carefully based on both their individual playstyles and the needs of the mission.</p>

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>We’ve always been huge fans of Zeratul as a character in the StarCraft universe, so we knew we wanted to bring him to Co-op. However, we already had a “Dark Templar” Commander in Vorazun, so we had to take special care to make Zeratul feel different enough from his Nerazim counterpart.</p>

<p>Right off the bat, we knew we wanted to have Zeratul as a controllable hero on the battlefield. And we wanted him to have a small elite fighting force, as he was most often featured in insurgent-style missions in the StarCraft II campaign. But we also knew this wouldn’t be enough, so we played the campaign to really dig into Zeratul’s identity beyond the fact that he’s a Dark Templar.</p>

<p>Throughout the campaign, Zeratul looked to the wisdom of the Xel’Naga for guidance, obsessed with finding their prophecies. We experimented with how we could incorporate this into his Commander design and eventually came up with the Prophetic Vision ability, which allows players to pierce the void to find the locations of procedurally-placed Xel’Naga Artifact Fragments hidden on each map.</p>

<p>In addition, we were committed to creating a Commander that felt and played differently from his Protoss brethren. To that end, Zeratul’s army will receive unique Xel’Naga enhancements, which should hopefully allow players to see traditional Protoss units in a completely new light. Our intention is to make Zeratul feel like a Xel’Naga Commander as much as he does a Protoss Commander.</p>

<p>Finally, during our playthrough of the campaign, we found that Zeratul had a curious habit of finding allies who were more than willing to sacrifice themselves for his sake. Inspired by this, we created the Legendary Legion calldowns, which allow players to call in reinforcements from other Protoss factions (often to send them to their deaths).</p>

<h2>Top Bar Abilities</h2>

<p>A level 15 Zeratul will have 3 choices for each of his top bar abilities. Adapt to the enemy and your mission objections and select your powers accordingly.</p>

<h3>Tier 1</h3>

<p><strong>Telbrus Legion </strong></p>

It’s only fitting that we bring their pastime home to Earth.</p>

<p><em>At BlizzCon on November 2-3, 2018, we’ll be serving up four (4) different con-exclusive StarCraft 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary beers with our friends at Bottle Logic: one for each classic StarCraft race, and a special commemorative anniversary ale.</em></p>

<p>To celebrate 20 years of StarCraft, these stellar beverages—<em>Haze of Adun</em> Hazy Pale Ale, <em>Nydus Nectar</em> Tart Ale, and <em>Stimpack</em> <em>Stout</em>—are available to sip at stations around the <a href="https://www.anaheim.net/1117/Anaheim-Convention-Center-Arena">Anaheim Convention Center</a> and at the neighboring <a href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/laxah-anaheim-marriott/">Anaheim Marriott</a> hotel bar while supplies last (note that alcohol sales in California require identification proving that you are age 21 or older).</p>

<p>In addition to draft pours at the aforementioned locations, you also can take away <em>Power Overwhelming</em> IPA in cool collectible cans from both the Anaheim Marriott and <a href="http://www.guestreservations.com/hilton-anaheim/booking?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6JiKzfac3gIVT21-Ch0MmwsxEAAYAyAAEgIE__D_BwE">Hilton</a> hotels.</p>

<p><strong>The Beers</strong></p>

<p><strong>Power Overwhelming Anniversary IPA (5.9% ABV)</strong></p>

<p>StarCraft’s 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary commemorative beer, <em>Power Overwhelming</em>, is a soft, tropical, deliciously easy-to-drink IPA in a limited-edition collectible can. While it won’t help you fuse into a supernal consciousness bent on eradicating the enemies of Aiur, you and a like-minded friend <em>can</em> line up your cans to show off both sides of a wraparound label that’s greater than the sum of its parts.</p>

<p><strong>Haze of Adun Pale Ale (5% ABV)</strong></p>

<p><em>Haze of Adun</em>’s pure and shining golden hue was inspired by the armor elite templar wear into battle. Its downy mouthfeel and juicy citrus bitterness might fill you with the very same psychic relaxation that washes over protoss warriors after victory against the zerg, or that might be a complete stretch. The beer’s still delicious.</p>

<p><strong>Nydus Nectar Tart Ale (5% ABV)</strong></p>

<p><em>Nydus Nectar </em>is a tart berliner weisse brewed with heaps of fresh blueberries and raspberries to produce a distinctive, brilliant purple hue. Its aroma brings to mind the humid primordial funk of Zerus, and it tastes much, much better than disgorging dozens of zerglings from your tunnel-sized maw.</p>

<p><strong>Stimpack Stout (8% ABV)</strong></p>

<p>A unique, subtly smoky coffee beer, <em>Stimpack Stout</em> has considerably more pleasant aftereffects than the more traditional Dominion psych-up. It’s lightly sweet and syrupy, and balances smoke and rich coffee flavors for a terran-friendly vibe that’ll leave you vigorously defending the jukebox.</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>Quest for Quality</strong></p>

<p>2018 marks our third beer-brewing adventure with Bottle Logic. Previous years have brought us <em>Inner Geek</em> Blizzard anniversary ale, <em>Warcraft</em>®<em> </em>anniversary <em>Thunderbrew</em>, and <em>Diablo</em>®<em> </em>anniversary <em>Horadric Ale</em> and <em>Dark Wanderer</em> stout. The more we work with Bottle Logic, the more we discover everything we have in common—similar commitments to quality, similar fixation on the craft (of everything from bottle labels to box art), and mutual appreciation for beer and games.</p>

<p>Starcraft Production Director Tim Morten describes the brewing process with Bottle Logic as extremely gratifying—they’ve invited members of the StarCraft team to give input on original concepts, to help tune the flavor profiles of each beer, and even to help decide on specific brewing techniques.</p>

<p>Bottle Logic Co-Founder Brandon Buckner describes beer iteration as similar to game development—a lot of talking, trying different ideas out, and learning as a group while an idea slowly takes form. “It’s kind of wild to think about the overlap there, and then to see the overlap of beer-fans and Blizzard fans connecting over our collaboration at BlizzCon” he says. “It’s really been a blast to have built so many great friendships with folks on the Blizzard teams.”</p>

<p><strong>Embracing our Inner Beer Geek</strong></p>

<p>Like all our geekery, beer geekery at Blizzard manifests in a variety of ways. Our company beer mailing list hosts discussions of favorite styles and recommendations for must-visit brewpubs throughout the world. We’ve even been known to set up the odd team bottle exchange—the StarCraft team’s running Thursday afternoon beer share is affectionally called “False Start.”</p>

<p>We’ve even gotten our friends at Bottle Logic in on the action—after collaborating on <em>Thunderbrew </em>for BlizzCon 2014, we farmed out the original recipe to Blizzard employees in a homebrew competition, judged by Bottle Logic’s brewmeisters. Buckner remembers one of his favorite employee-brewed variants featuring peppercorns harvested from the Blizzard Irvine campus, and another that pumped up the base beer with chai spice.</p>

<p>The Bottle Logic half of our fun-development archon hasn’t been shy about their gaming proclivities, either. After seeing StarCraft’s cinematics for the first time (which he says “totally blew his mind”), Brandon begged his parents for a year to get his first computer so he could play it. He’s enjoying StarCraft II’s co-op mode as we head into BlizzCon.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><img alt="" src="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/gallery/5TKNXPX28X7J1540507170406.png" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;"/></em></p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>See you at BlizzCon!</strong></p>

<p>The Anaheim Convention Center at BlizzCon 2018 will be the only place to get cans of <em>Power Overwhelming</em> and pours of <em>Nydus Nectar</em>, <em>Haze of Adun </em>and <em>Stimpack Stout</em>. Even if you don’t plan on attending the con, you can still stop by the Hilton, Marriot, or one of the convention center's outdoor beer gardens to celebrate with us.</p>

<p>And, if you’re in town for more than just the duration of BlizzCon 2018, stop by Bottle Logic’s <a href="http://bottlelogic.com/tasting-room/">tasting room</a> in Anaheim to try their latest. They don’t have a Blizzard arcade cabinet, but obviously, iteration's key there too.</p>

<p>Cheers to 20 years, Commanders!</p>
