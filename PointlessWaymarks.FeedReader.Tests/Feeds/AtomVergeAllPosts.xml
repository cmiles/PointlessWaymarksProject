    <title>This is the new Hulu experience with live TV</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="MgoyH9"&gt;Hulu is giving closed-door demonstrations of its upcoming internet TV service here at CES in Las Vegas. The fact that Hulu plans to challenge Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, and DirecTV Now isnâ€™t new; the company has been trickling out details â€” network agreements, mainly â€” over the last few months. This week Hulu revealed that its service will be priced at under $40 monthly. For reference, Sling starts at $20-per-month, Vue at $30 (or $40 in markets with live network programming), and DirecTV Now at $35. Iâ€™ve now seen what Huluâ€™s been working on, albeit very briefly, and it shows a lot of promise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="78WfPT"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RN3Sru"&gt;For Huluâ€™s asking price, youâ€™ll get live TV, two simultaneous streams, a cloud DVR feature (with a â€œsmallâ€ amount of storage according to SVP...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge Awards at CES 2017: Hi, Alexa</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OlmxvXYhyMKZtDLpyntxtHMvazk=/137x0:1640x1002/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52574303/Verge_CES_Awards_v3_LHeroImage.0.0.png" /&gt;



  		 &lt;p&gt;For at least the second year in a row, CES was quiet. Much like 2016's show, this year's consumer electronics spectacle lacked blockbuster products, brands behaving badly, or unpredictable trends. Technology, whether it's our phones, TVs, or computers, is in its adult period, where changes happen slowly and iteratively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was still movement at CES this year. Self-driving technology took a couple more baby steps forward, while the smart home continued to expand and develop. Even the age-old PC was interesting, as Windows laptops showed they could have sleek designs with great battery life; monitors grew even larger and got more pixels; and the lowly Chromebook was imbued with new life (and a stylus).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inescapable trend...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Russia is erasing Linkedin from app stores</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ahDdJb0MH2Id-cvbuDj-GTK7ngw=/0x0:4412x2941/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52637725/630609166.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="ALzsri"&gt;Apple and Google have agreed to remove LinkedIn from iOS and Android app stores in Russia, according to a new report &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/technology/linkedin-blocked-in-russia.html?_r=0"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In November, the service was ruled to be in violation of &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/4/5871565/russia-passes-law-requiring-online-personal-data-to-be-stored-inside-its-borders"&gt;a 2014 law&lt;/a&gt; requiring all data collected on Russian citizens to be stored within Russian borders. Moving data within Russian borders has been widely viewed as a first step towards more aggressive surveillance measures, and many web companies have declined to relocate their data centers to comply with the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppsoUh"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/6/13855408/microsoft-linkedin-acquisition-cleared"&gt;Acquired by Microsoft last year&lt;/a&gt;, LinkedIn is the largest service to fall victim to the new law so far. Web access to LinkedIn was &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-linkedin-diplomacy-idUSKBN13D0ST"&gt;blocked in November&lt;/a&gt; through cooperation with the state telecom, but was still accessible to users with a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Nick Offerman react to the nonsense gadgets of CES 2017</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GikTxKGOGNmuFQXLTbOSsf3s9kY=/52x0:585x355/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52637265/Screen_Shot_2017-01-06_at_5.58.33_PM.0.0.png" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="M21m8M"&gt;CES is as much about the future as it about the junk that gets left behind. Here in the cavernous halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center and the suites of the city's most opulent hotels and casinos, we see a lot of gadgets that spring up out of nowhere as fast as they fade into obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a promotional campaign for his American Greetings brand of greeting cards, &lt;i&gt;Parks and Recreations &lt;/i&gt;star Nick Offerman came to Vegas to opine about the pitfalls of modern technology. As part of the campaign, the gruff and deadpan lover of whiskey and woodworking toured some of the show's lovably weird nonsense with &lt;i&gt;The Verge&lt;/i&gt;'s own Casey Newton this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the video above to see him spanking a robot, look perplexingly at a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>15 questions and answers about Underworld: Blood Wars</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SuBuMTxqF_XyFPR9AdWeQ8sAeoQ=/305x0:1055x500/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52636839/UnderworldFrostedTips.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="fuVY5j"&gt;The latest &lt;em&gt;Underworld &lt;/em&gt;movie just hit theaters. It wasnâ€™t screened for critics, with good reason: This is a review-proof movie. In fact, there isnâ€™t much point in reviewing it, since itâ€™s so clearly a fan-service movie, made with franchise fans in mind. So instead, hereâ€™s a rundown of mildly spoilery questions that address what goes on in the movie, who itâ€™s for, how silly it all gets, and whether the movie lets Kate Beckinsale keep jumping from high objects and landing in a perfect superheroine crouch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vI3U1L"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KQs6h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So are there any blood wars in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underworld: Blood Wars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, or is that just a fancy name?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8DbfKe"&gt;There are actually multiple blood wars in the movie! The overarching one is the 1,500-year battle between vampires and lycans (that is, werewolves) that...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I played Battlefield on Razerâ€™s three-screen laptop</title>

  &lt;p id="benqhk"&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/5/14112686/razer-project-valerie-multi-monitor-gaming-laptop-concept"&gt;Razer Project Valerie&lt;/a&gt; prototype is a laptop with not one, not two, but three 17-inch displays. It can run &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 1&lt;/em&gt; at 12K resolution with perfectly smooth frame rates. Thereâ€™s no price or release date, as this is far from becoming a real product, but if Razer finds enough demand from users, the company promises to build this crazy concoction for real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iBskic"&gt;I played on it, so let me tell you what thatâ€™s like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afPCqt"&gt;Razer has set brought two Project Valerie examples to CES: one that works and demonstrates the full performance but isnâ€™t particularly refined in its cosmetics, and another that has the looks down but canâ€™t be played. As such, it makes it tough to judge the final product, should there ever be one. The functional prototype has the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New York Cityâ€™s closest nuclear power plant may close in five years</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_38JoOND-SKJqsemVu2ISuDfYdk=/594x0:3327x1822/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52636287/Indian_Point_Nuclear_Power_Plant.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="emD71R"&gt;Earlier today, the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/nyregion/indian-point-nuclear-power-plant-shutdown.html?_r=0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that the Indian Point nuclear power plant will close by 2021. However, a spokesperson for New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that the deal is not yet finalized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unATZa"&gt;The&lt;a href="http://www.safesecurevital.com/about-us/"&gt; Indian Point Energy Center&lt;/a&gt; is home to three nuclear reactors, only two of which are active. Itâ€™s located on the edge of the Hudson river in Buchanan, New York â€” about &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Manhattan,+New+York,+NY/Buchanan,+NY+10511/@41.025945,-74.1292845,10z/am=t/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2588f046ee661:0xa0b3281fcecc08c!2m2!1d-73.9712488!2d40.7830603!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2cf57acba38ef:0xa23e350fb397f034!2m2!1d-73.9381943!2d41.2620383"&gt;an hourâ€™s drive from Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;. Government officials &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/nyregion/plan-to-expand-a-pipeline-at-indian-point-raises-concern.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FIndian%20Point%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant%20(NY)&amp;amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;amp;amp;region=stream&amp;amp;amp;module=stream_unit&amp;amp;amp;version=latest&amp;amp;amp;contentPlacement=5&amp;amp;amp;pgtype=collection"&gt;are concerned&lt;/a&gt; that if a natural disaster or terrorist attack were to damage the plant, it could devastate nearby New York City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIBv73"&gt;â€œFor years, my office has been fighting to address the serious risks posed by Indian Point to the surrounding communities and the environment,â€ New York Attorney General &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/"&gt;Eric T....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Icaros is like VR skydiving crossed with planking</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r65456vBl_MGvkjIdY6CWENcZXo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52635785/IMG_6645.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="llZUNx"&gt;â€œHave we seen the Icaros?â€ I asked my editor Thomas Ricker on Slack this morning. â€œIt's like a weird VR flying frame.â€&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fs6xNB"&gt;â€œWe did something. Not sure it was this,â€ he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfo4MB"&gt;There was a time when VR peripherals were so singular that each one opened up some totally new sensorial frontier. This morning, I had to rack my brain to remember precisely &lt;em&gt;which &lt;/em&gt;virtual reality flying machines people had already seen this week. The answer turned out to be the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/verge/videos/vb.193742123995472/1306360672733606/?type=2&amp;amp;theater"&gt;Hypersuit&lt;/a&gt;, which looks much like the Icaros, but has a fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KhWKPi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Specialized VR hardware is starting to feel a lot like exercise equipment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BeRAva"&gt;Maybe this doesnâ€™t sound like the most upbeat beginning to a gadget story, but I donâ€™t actually think itâ€™s a bad thing. Specialized VR hardware is starting to feel...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitbit plans to launch its own app store this year</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cUTd9SHKWCIQdLa8u1_D0Phbjj8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52635089/verge-2016-09-21_14-29-06.0.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="oz3Uvb"&gt;Fitbit wants to launch its own wearable app store â€œas soon as possible,â€ the companyâ€™s co-founder and CEO James Park said in an interview at CES earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z20wRt"&gt;The new app store would be built using some of the assets Fitbit acquired from Pebble when it &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/7/13867158/fitbit-buys-pebble-smartwatch-acquisition-deal"&gt;bought the struggling wearable startup&lt;/a&gt; last month. In its five years of existence Pebble amassed around 14,000 third-party apps in its store, and Park said Pebble had â€œworked out a lot of the kinksâ€ that go into building an app store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmgK5S"&gt;Park noted that an app store would be especially helpful as Fitbit tries to extend its relationships with employers and health care companies that are using Fitbits for corporate wellness programs. Earlier this week, Fitbit said that it was partnering with...&lt;/p&gt;
