        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/photo-video-editing-apps-mobile" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/beforeafterphotoedit-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="The 13 Best Photo &amp;amp; Video Editing Apps for Mobile" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By now, it's clear that creating great visual content is critical for marketers -- and that's especially true on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It was recently announced that &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/15/13960412/instagram-600m-monthly-active-users"&gt;Instagram has doubled its monthly active user base since 2014&lt;/a&gt;, which means a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more people are viewing and sharing photos. Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;visual content is 40X more likely to get shared on social media than other types&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, people like to be shown, not told -- and in turn, they share.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/beforeafterphotoedit-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=761&amp;amp;name=beforeafterphotoedit-compressor.jpg" alt="beforeafterphotoedit-compressor.jpg" width="761" title="beforeafterphotoedit-compressor.jpg" style="width: 761px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By now, it's clear that creating great visual content is critical for marketers -- and that's especially true on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It was recently announced that &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/15/13960412/instagram-600m-monthly-active-users"&gt;Instagram has doubled its monthly active user base since 2014&lt;/a&gt;, which means a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more people are viewing and sharing photos. Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;visual content is 40X more likely to get shared on social media than other types&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, people like to be shown, not told -- and in turn, they share.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For that reason, it's important for marketers to know how to create compelling visuals for their business' social networks and blogs. And while it can be worth putting the&amp;nbsp;investment of time and money into photo editing software on your computer, &lt;a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/01/23/personal-photos-videos-user-generated-content-statistics/"&gt;many of us are exclusively using our phones to take pictures&lt;/a&gt; and could stand to edit them without uploading them to a desktop. That's especially true when you're posting in real time, like at an event. &lt;a class="cta_button" href="https://offers.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=4afe9b8e-78ab-40ee-8285-08b9042e0c1e&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid="&gt; &lt;img class="hs-cta-img " style="border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; " alt=" " src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4afe9b8e-78ab-40ee-8285-08b9042e0c1e.png"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are tons of great photo and video editing apps out there for mobile devices -- some of them even cost a few bucks. But which are the best, free or paid? Check out our shortlist below.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;13 of the Best Photo &amp;amp; Video Editing Apps for Mobile&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Photo Editing Apps&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1) Afterlight&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;$0.99 | &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/afterlight/id573116090?mt=8"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fueled.afterlight&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/afterlight/5d5d961a-87ba-4372-9b0d-9170abe9e04a"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There was a time when I was a bit more old-school in my photo editing. I counted on Instagram tools alone, sometimes combining them with the "enhance" feature on my phone's Photos app. Then, I learned about Afterlight -- a somewhat rudimentary tool, but one that has all the features you need to do a basic photo edit.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From controlling the color tones, to adjusting exposure and brightness, to rotating and straightening&amp;nbsp;a photo, it has everything you need for lighting or color fixes. It also contains 74 filters, including a Fusion feature that lets you mix tools, filters, and textures to create your own personal look. Into frames? Afterlight has a whopping 128 to choose from, boasting a perfect pairing with Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My favorite tools, though, have to be the ones for Brightness and Shadows. Some pictures do well with a decrease in shadows and increase in brightness for cleaner, fresher look. But flipping those around can also create a more mysterious, nighttime feel -- That's what I&amp;nbsp;did with this photo of tree ornaments.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Afterlight_before.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;name=Afterlight_before.png" width="300" alt="Afterlight_before.png" title="Afterlight_before.png" style="width: 300px;"&gt; &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Afterlight_after.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;name=Afterlight_after.png" width="300" alt="Afterlight_after.png" title="Afterlight_after.png" style="width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;2) VSCO Cam&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Free | &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vsco-cam/id588013838?mt=8"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vsco.cam&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, VSCO Cam has become a highly popular photo editing app for mobile. While it does boast a wider set of editing tools than most other editing apps, its main claim to fame is its filters.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These filters have a softer, more authentic look that resembles real film, compared to&amp;nbsp;the over-saturated looks of many Instagram filters. Plus, it's great for when you need to edit a photo on the fly. Simply upload the photo to VSCO Cam, slap on one of the great filters -- I&amp;nbsp;used C1 below -- and call it a day. (There are more filters available for purchase, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/VSCO_before.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;name=VSCO_before.png" width="300" alt="VSCO_before.png" title="VSCO_before.png" style="width: 300px;"&gt; &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/VSCO_after.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;name=VSCO_after.png" width="300" alt="VSCO_after.png" title="VSCO_after.png" style="width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;3) Snapseed&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Free | &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619?mt=8"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Snapseed is another app that's great for basic image enhancements. It's got all the classic adjustment tools, such as tuning, cropping, and straightening. Plus, its sharpening tool is one of the best we've seen -- it really does enhance a photo's detail, without making it look grainy, like many other photo sharpening adjusters out there.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But what makes this tool particularly unique is its "Selective Adjust" tool. It allows&amp;nbsp;you to pinpoint an area in a photo and adjust the brightness, contrast, and saturation of that single point. So if you want viewers to focus on a certain part of your photo -- say, the buds in the center of a plant -- then you can make the buds&amp;nbsp;more vivid.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Want more help with Snapseed? Google, the maker of the app, created a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/snapseed#topic=6155507"&gt;dedicated support page&lt;/a&gt; with tips and instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Snapseed_Tools.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;name=Snapseed_Tools.png" width="300" alt="Snapseed_Tools.png" title="Snapseed_Tools.png" style="width: 300px;"&gt; &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Snapseed_Select%20Adjust.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;name=Snapseed_Select%20Adjust.png" width="300" alt="Snapseed_Select Adjust.png" title="Snapseed_Select Adjust.png" style="width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;4) Camera+&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;$2.99 | &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camera+/id329670577?mt=8"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; only&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With the highest price tag on the list, you have to wonder what makes Camera+ so special. When it was first released, &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5820862/the-best-camera-app-for-iphone"&gt;Lifehacker&lt;/a&gt; called it "The Best Camera App for iPhone," with &lt;a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2044480_2043672_2043686,00.html"&gt;TIME&lt;/a&gt; writing, "If the iPhone's standard camera is like a digital point-and-shoot, the Camera+ app is like a high-quality SLR lens."&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While the app has many of the classic photo editing tools like color tints, retro effects, and crops, there are a few gems that make it unique. First is its image stabilizer, which helps you capture the sharpest photos possible before you even take a picture. It also lets you zoom in up to 6X, which can really up the quality of your shot if you're trying to hone in on something far away.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finally, its Clarity filter is what &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303816504577305702578426084"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303816504577305702578426084"&gt;'s Kevin Sintumuang calls&lt;/a&gt; its "secret sauce -- it adds pro-camera crispness to almost any shot." I'd have to agree -- just check out how it enhanced this photo of my&amp;nbsp;dog.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Camera%2B1.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Camera%2B1.jpg" width="669" alt="Camera+1.jpg" title="Camera+1.jpg" style="width: 669px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Camera%2B2.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;name=Camera%2B2.png" alt="Camera+2.png" width="300" title="Camera+2.png" style="width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;5) Mextures&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;$0.99 | &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mextures/id650415564?mt=8"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; only&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mextures is one of the more advanced apps on this list -- and its crown jewel is layer-based editing. That&amp;nbsp;allows users&amp;nbsp;to stack different adjustment layers on top of each other, moving and editing them individually, allowing&amp;nbsp;for nearly limitless creativity. You can also apply multiple filters, textures, and blending models to the same photo to create a really unique look. If you find an editing formula you really like, you can save it to apply to other photos later, or even share it with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here's what happened when I&amp;nbsp;took a simple photo of candlesticks on a white background only and applied three enhancements -- Waterfront overlay, Bokeh Baby Overlay, and the Color Dodge blending mode.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Mextures_before.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;name=Mextures_before.png" width="300" alt="Mextures_before.png" title="Mextures_before.png" style="width: 300px;"&gt; &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Mextures_after.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;name=Mextures_after.png" width="300" alt="Mextures_after.png" title="Mextures_after.png" style="width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;6) SKRWT&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;$0.99 | &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skrwt/id834248867?mt=8"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=accky.kreved.skrwt.skrwt"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ever taken a picture of something straight-on -- a doorway, a building, your food -- and found the perspective was just a &lt;em&gt;little &lt;/em&gt;bit askew or tilted? The SKRWT app lets you adjust the perspective of your photos to make the lines look clean and square.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Have a look at what I was&amp;nbsp;able to do with a simple window shot.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/SKRWT_before.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=SKRWT_before.jpg" style="width: 669px;" width="669" alt="SKRWT_before.jpg" title="SKRWT_before.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/SKRWT_after.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=SKRWT_after.jpg" width="669" style="width: 669px;" alt="SKRWT_after.jpg" title="SKRWT_after.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"&gt;At first, the "before" image doesn't look that skewed, but seeing the "after" version really shows what a difference symmetry can make. If it bugs you to see a photo that's slightly at an angle, then this app is well worth the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;7) Live&amp;nbsp;Collage&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Free | &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instacollage-collage-maker/id530957474?mt=8"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Photo collages can be great, whether it's to show a comparison (like a before-and-after series), or to highlight multiple photos from the same event or theme. Our&amp;nbsp;favorite photo collage app is InstaCollage, mostly because of its wide variety of layouts. It contains several layouts, both classic and fun ones with interesting, colorful backgrounds. Plus, you can add customized text in different fonts, colors, and sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you're strapped for time, there are basic photo editing options within the app, too, making it a handy one-stop shop.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instacollage1.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;name=Instacollage1.png" width="300" alt="Instacollage1.png" title="Instacollage1.png" style="width: 300px;"&gt; &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instacollage2.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;name=Instacollage2.png" width="300" alt="Instacollage2.png" title="Instacollage2.png" style="width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;8) Foodie&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Free | &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/foodie-delicious-camera-for/id1076859004?mt=8"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.linecorp.foodcam.android&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you're anything like I am, your personal social media feeds are loaded with images of food. It's no wonder that food-specific apps are coming out of the woodwork to make photos look even more delectable.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Called out by Bustle for taking "food pictures to some next level gorgeous," Foodie uses over 26 filters and other editing features to turn what might otherwise be a humdrum snack into a visual feast.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When I&amp;nbsp;applied the CR2 filter to a photo of chocolate candy, this was the result:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Foodie_before.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;name=Foodie_before.png" width="300" alt="Foodie_before.png" title="Foodie_before.png" style="width: 300px;"&gt; &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Foodie_after.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;name=Foodie_after.png" width="300" alt="Foodie_after.png" title="Foodie_after.png" style="width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;9) Visage Makeup Editor&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Free | &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/visage-makeup-editor-beauty/id489833171?mt=8"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; only&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: There's absolutely nothing wrong with under-eye circles. We all have them, and we sometimes wear them like medals. (We do, however, take issue with and don't recommend a lack of sleep.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That said, when it comes to sharing photos of ourselves on social media, vanity sometimes enters the picture. Sound familiar? There's an app for that.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We like&amp;nbsp;the Visage makeup editor, which instantly retouches photos and lets you add some special effects, like a "Pop Art Style" filter that can make your selfie look slightly Warhol-esque. The app comes equipped with some interesting backgrounds, as well as lighting and color features, with more available for purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The only drawback? The free version is a bit ad-heavy, and unless you upgrade to pro, your finished product will be stuck with a branded hashtag at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Visage_before.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;name=Visage_before.png" width="300" alt="Visage_before.png" title="Visage_before.png" style="width: 300px;"&gt; &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Visage_after.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=296&amp;amp;name=Visage_after.jpg" width="296" alt="Visage_after.jpg" title="Visage_after.jpg" style="width: 296px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Video Editing Apps&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;10) Splice&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Free | &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id409838725?mt=8"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; only&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It only seems fitting that the makers of GoPro would also release an app that allows you -- as the name suggests -- to splice together different video clips on your phone to create a moving collage.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We had a lot of fun playing with this one, especially since Splice even contains a library of musical tracks -- among other features, like custom transition length -- that can be used as a background for your finished product. You can also use the app to trim and edit the different pieces of video.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I experimented with Splice by compiling this&amp;nbsp;15-second&amp;nbsp;video of my dog&amp;nbsp;-- using only an iPhone 6.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;11) Hyperlapse&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Free | &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperlapse-from-instagram/id740146917?mt=8"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; only&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hyperlapse is an app created by the folks at Instagram that condenses videos into brief, hyper-speed videos that you can upload to Instagram or Facebook. You can choose among a few different speeds, and the app will show you how long the hyperlapsed video will be for every speed in comparison to the length of the video in real time. (So a 40-second video in real time will become roughly a 7-second video in Hyperlapse at 6X speed.) It's a really cool way to capture something that usually lasts a while -- like a sunset or an event setup.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here's what happened when I&amp;nbsp;used Hyperlapse to film daybreak&amp;nbsp;at 12X:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;12) PicPlayPost&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Free | &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/picplaypost/id498127541?mt=8"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flambestudios.picplaypost&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We've already covered the coolness of photo collages. But what if you could make a &lt;em&gt;video &lt;/em&gt;collage? PicPlayPost is a simple app that lets you do exactly that. Just remember that the sound from both videos will play at the same time, so be sure they won't clash with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are many uses for a video collage app, but my colleague, &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/author/lindsay-kolowich#sm.00000xfcwacn05egyvxc894f0fucx"&gt;Lindsay Kolowich&lt;/a&gt;, particularly likes the way fitness professional Melissa Made uses it on her Instagram account. She posts video collages with her performing a workout on one side, while she explains the workout out loud on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);"&gt;
        &lt;div style="padding: 8px;"&gt;
        &lt;div style="background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50.0% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;"&gt;
        &amp;nbsp;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://instagram.com/p/60__-mzJbe/" style="color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;"&gt;WHOA! That's a mouthful! . Grab a heavy dumbbell, bag of rice or book and complete this circuit several times to work ALL those muscles listed plus some added cardio! . 1âƒ£ Squat and bicep curl 2âƒ£ Bowler lunge and row right 3âƒ£ Calf raise, overhead press and tricep extension 4âƒ£ Bowler lunge and row left 5âƒ£ Deadlift and back row . The key is to make your range of motion BIG. But as always, keep your chest lifted, abs in tight and knees behind toes. . Put in a good song and do it half tempo a few times and then tempo a few. The variety will definitely benefit both strength and cardio!!!&#x1f4aa;&#x1f3fc;&#x1f3c3;&#x1f3fb;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"&gt;A video posted by &#x1f338;Melissa McAllister&#x1f338; (@melissamade) on Aug 25, 2015 at 6:27pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;13) InShot&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Free | &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/picplaypost/id498127541?mt=8"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flambestudios.picplaypost&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then, there are the times when you just want to edit a video -- no fancy collages and no splicing. For that, there's InShot, a handy app that lets you trim, speed up, or add music and filters to video. It's pretty fundamental, but with that comes a high ease of use. You can also add a background, if you like, though we think it's pretty cool to have an overlap of images, like we did with the video below.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;nbsp;took a simple video of a tranquil beach scene, but enhanced it with InShot's "warm filter," and added a fitting musical track to it -- a song called &lt;a href="https://itun.es/us/TCIrp?i=256256085"&gt;"Pikake Stream," by Kalani&lt;/a&gt;. (I recommend viewing the video in its entirety with headphones, especially if you're having a stressful day.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Now Comes the Fun Part&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;See how easy it is to create and share visual content? Of course, mastering these apps will require a bit of practice, but if you're unsure where to start, just look around you -- that's what we did when we tried each of them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Think about your marketing goals for this year. Then, ask yourself what kind of visual content -- format and subject, for example -- will help you accomplish them. From there, you can pick and choose the best apps from this list.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So start getting visual. We can't wait to see what you create.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are your favorite photo and video editing apps for mobile? Share with us in the comments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There's something about the word "poster" that seems very ... retro. I remember having a Metallica poster hanging in my room as an angstry teenager. Who knew that they might someday pertain to my line of work?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As it turns out, posters aren't as old-school as we might think. In fact, they're still quite effective devices for promoting events.&amp;nbsp;Making yours stand out, however, is the tricky part.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;As it turns out, posters aren't as old-school as we might think. In fact, they're still quite effective devices for promoting events.&amp;nbsp;Making yours stand out, however, is the tricky part.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Like so many other things in marketing, it requires a combination of creativity and formula. But what are the success factors? And what makes a poster look its best?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You're in luck. Our friends at &lt;a href="https://venngage.com/blog/poster-design/"&gt;Venngage&lt;/a&gt;, who know a thing or two about creating compelling visuals, put together this infographic to guide you along your poster-making journey. It'll help you figure out what information is essential to include on your poster, and how to make it aesthetically appealing -- without overwhelming the viewer.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And despite what you may think, email marketing is still growing: Gmail alone has &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/432390/active-gmail-users/"&gt;1 billion users&lt;/a&gt; worldwide, and The Radicati Group predicts that there will be&lt;a href="http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Email_Statistics_Report_2016-2020_Executive_Summary.pdf"&gt; 3 billion email users&lt;/a&gt; worldwide by 2020 (thatâ€™s almost half of the worldâ€™s population).&lt;a class="cta_button" href="https://offers.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=c87ba43f-f237-4307-8f03-9c6e7e2eb6b7&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid="&gt; &lt;img class="hs-cta-img " style="border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; " alt="Reap the positive ROI benefits of email marketing with the help of this  14-point checklist for optimizing your emails.&amp;nbsp;" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/c87ba43f-f237-4307-8f03-9c6e7e2eb6b7.png"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Certainly email is &lt;a href="http://www.marketingtechnews.net/news/2016/oct/13/emails-not-dead-its-just-getting-harder-do-well/"&gt;not dead&lt;/a&gt;, but it is getting harder to do well. HubSpot Postmaster and Email Engineering Director&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/computertom"&gt; Tom Monaghan&lt;/a&gt; distilled his wisdom into a set of guidelines for email marketing for growth in 2017 at &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC81yRiCDts&amp;amp;t=1380s"&gt;INBOUND &lt;/a&gt;last year. Read on to learn what strategies you should start implementing, absolutely avoid, and keep up in 2017 and in years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;How to Improve Your Email Marketing in 2017&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1) Send emails to lists that want to hear from you.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you have email lists with low rates of engagement activity, stop sending to them. Every time you send to a list with low open and engagement rates, it hurts your domain reputation and your chances of connecting with other potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Monaghan said it best in his talk: â€œYou are what you eat, and so is your marketing.â€ When you receive tons of emails from brands you donâ€™t engage with, constantly deleting them or marking them as â€œreadâ€ is most likely tiresome. Empathize with your subscribers and treat their inbox the way you would want your inbox treated.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;2) Have a goal for each email before you press â€œsend.â€&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you donâ€™t have a goal in mind for the emails youâ€™re sending, the recipients wonâ€™t know what the goal is, either. Once you define a goal for your email sends, you can define success and build a list to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Goals for your emails could include a contact filling out a longer form for a gated content offer to provide your team with more information about their organization, or redeeming a promo code for a purchase on your website.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Give recipients options in your messages, such as calls-to-action and links in text, so they have multiple avenues to achieve your goal. Everyoneâ€™s behavior is different, so make your emails flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;3) Personalize and test your emails.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34146/7-excellent-examples-of-email-personalization-in-action.aspx#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;Email personalization&lt;/a&gt; really works. For example, back in 2014, we found that emails with the recipientsâ€™ first names in the subject lines had &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/science-of-email-marketing-2014-report?_ga=1.117105990.170111609.1470925141"&gt;higher clickthrough rates&lt;/a&gt; than emails that didnâ€™t.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When it comes to personalizing your emails, stick with the basics. Personalize according to recipient names and company names, but to avoid being creepy, leave it at that, urges Monaghan.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nothing is less personal than receiving a â€œDear Customerâ€ or â€œDear First Nameâ€ email, so test every email to make sure youâ€™re sending to recipient names.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;4) Send emails from a personalized account.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Donâ€™t send emails from a â€œnoreplyâ€ email account. Personalization works on your end, too. Boost your engagement by personalizing the â€œfromâ€ email address to drive replies from subscribers to a real person instead of â€œnoreply@company.com.â€&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;5) Experiment with sending emails on different days of the week.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Stop sending emails on Tuesdays. Seriously, stop.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays are &lt;a href="http://coschedule.com/blog/best-time-to-send-email/"&gt;the most popular days&lt;/a&gt; to send email, but theyâ€™re oversaturated with messages that might be overwhelming your subscribers. If you want your emails to be opened, try sending them on Mondays and Fridays. Emails with &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/great-call-to-action-examples"&gt;calls-to-action&lt;/a&gt; perform well on Saturdays, so donâ€™t be afraid to send emails on the weekend, either.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In any case, try experimenting with your approach to lessen your subscribersâ€™ email load &lt;a href="http://www.informz.com/resources/library/2016-association-email-marketing-benchmark-report/?rand=65105"&gt;Tuesday through Thursday,&lt;/a&gt; when most business emails are sent.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;6) Engage with contacts who've submitted forms, not contacts whose information youâ€™ve imported.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When someone fills out a form and provides their email address, their engagement rates are typically higher than cold contacts youâ€™ve imported from a list. Thatâ€™s because they want to hear from you and chose to engage with your content -- theyâ€™ve told you this by filling out a form. This is evidence that the inbound marketing methodology is working for email marketers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And by the way, &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32892/Why-Purchasing-Email-Lists-Is-Always-a-Bad-Idea.aspx#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;donâ€™t buy email lists&lt;/a&gt; -- youâ€™re only hurting your credibility and annoying people who havenâ€™t asked to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;7) Suppress your unengaged subscribers to avoid sending graymail.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You may be sending spam without knowing it, and thatâ€™s because the definition of spam has changed. &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-blog-email-graymail-strategy"&gt;Graymail&lt;/a&gt; refers to bulk email messages that arenâ€™t &lt;i&gt;technically&lt;/i&gt; spam because the recipients gave you their information, but the fact of the matter is, they get your emails and donâ€™t touch them. Engagement rates plummet if recipients donâ€™t open your first email, so if they continue ignoring you, the probability of them ever opening your messages is going way, way down.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Stop sending graymail, and listen to what people are telling you by &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; opening your emails. Start &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-suppression-lists#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;suppressing&lt;/a&gt; your unengaged subscribers. That way, your open rates will increase, and inbox providers will see that youâ€™re responding to subscriber behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;8) If people are unsubscribing, donâ€™t worry too much (yet).&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You canâ€™t please everyone, and &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-unsubscribe-pages#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;unsubscribes&lt;/a&gt; will happen. Luckily, your subscribers didnâ€™t mark you as spam -- they simply told you, in the nicest way possible, that theyâ€™re not interested in hearing from you anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Donâ€™t be too worried yet, but if more people keep unsubscribing, try to identify the potential cause. Consider suppressing or sending fewer emails to subscribers who arenâ€™t engaging as much.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;9) If people stop opening your emails, figure out whatâ€™s going wrong fast.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If your &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/metrics-email-marketers-should-be-tracking"&gt;email open rate&lt;/a&gt; is falling, it means youâ€™re missing the expectations of your recipients and that you should prepare for worse outcomes. Itâ€™s a leading indicator that spam complaints and unsubscribes are coming, and you should immediately suppress your unengaged subscribers to show email providers that youâ€™re responding to feedback. Test different emails to see if you can improve your open rates.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;10) If people mark you as spam, immediately stop sending email and identify the source of the complaints.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If youâ€™re being &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30594/a-marketer-s-guide-to-getting-past-email-spam-filters.aspx#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;marked as spam&lt;/a&gt;, your domain reputation is at risk, and you could become blacklisted by email providers. Whether the spam complaints are caused by a new source, bad forms, or you missing expectations of your list, slow or completely stop sending emails until you figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you arenâ€™t getting unsubscribe or spam complaints, that doesnâ€™t necessarily mean youâ€™re in the clear -- the messages could be going straight to recipientsâ€™ junk folders.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;11) If you want to learn more about email marketing, take the free email marketing certification course.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Learn more about email marketing with Monaghan right now by taking HubSpot Academyâ€™s &lt;a href="https://certification.hubspot.com/email-marketing-certification-course"&gt;Email Marketing Certification course&lt;/a&gt;. In only 3.5 hours, you'll learn about lifecycle marketing, email list segmentation, design, deliverability, and more skills to help you cultivate a strong strategy for 2017 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;12) Be thoughtful about your subject line.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Donâ€™t write clickbait &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/improve-your-email-subject-line"&gt;email subject lines&lt;/a&gt;. When people click on your email and then immediately bounce away when they realize your subject line wasnâ€™t genuine, your clickthrough rates will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For best results, customize and personalize email subject lines and &lt;a href="https://blog.crazyegg.com/2015/08/14/emojis-in-email/"&gt;experiment with emojis&lt;/a&gt;. Pro tip: Read subject lines out loud before sending. Would you open that email if you received it?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;13) Remember: Email is getting harder, but itâ€™s still working.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Every year, engagement rates start to slip, and it gets harder to reach peopleâ€™s inboxes. This doesnâ€™t mean that email marketing is losing its efficacy, itâ€™s just getting more competitive. The divide is growing between email marketers who know what theyâ€™re doing and those who donâ€™t, so make sure to put in effort to &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33635/12-automated-email-workflows-you-ll-kick-yourself-for-not-using.aspx#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;test different strategies&lt;/a&gt; and keep your subscribers engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The theme of all of these email marketing guidelines? Testing. Every audience and contacts database is different, so make sure youâ€™re testing the implementation of new strategies and tailoring them according to how your subscribers engage. And when youâ€™re ready to hit â€œsend,â€ here are some &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/lead-nurturing-email-examples#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;lead nurturing email examples&lt;/a&gt; to inspire your creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>7 Resolutions Your School's Marketing Department Should Make</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/7-resolutions-your-schools-marketing-department-should-make</link>
      <description>
        &lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/7-resolutions-your-schools-marketing-department-should-make" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/ThinkstockPhotos-607480306.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="ThinkstockPhotos-607480306.jpg" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It's once again that time of year for taking a good look at the lessons we've learned from our marketing efforts and resolving what we will, or won't, do again in 2017:&lt;/p&gt;
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Resolutions_Education_2017.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;height=302&amp;amp;name=Resolutions_Education_2017.png" alt="Resolutions_Education_2017.png" width="730" height="302"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It's once again that time of year for taking a good look at the lessons we've learned from our marketing efforts and resolving what we will, or won't, do again in 2017:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Less Bulk Email&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Your prospects want to know you see them. &lt;a href="http://www.cmo.com/features/articles/2015/2/18/mind-blowing-stats-personalization.html#gs.QICuvvs"&gt;Personalized emails provide 6x the transaction rates as generic email&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the bar for what qualifies as "personalized" is getting higher. Personalization no more precise than segmenting your list into prospects and parents of prospects doesn't meet expectations. Your prospects want to feel that you see them as an individual. That means knowing what questions they have, whether they prefer Instagram to Twitter, or even Facebook, and send them videos, not reports. When you collect information through their digital behavior and &lt;a href="http://academy.hubspot.com/projects/customer-projects-form-optimization"&gt;optimized online forms&lt;/a&gt;, put that intel to use when customizing the content you email individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Better communication with Enrollment/Admissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a symbiotic relationship. The stronger the relationship between Marketing and Admissions, the more effective both departments are. Admissions folks are great sources of intel regarding what current prospects' pressing questions are, or understanding why applicants do and don't enroll. Their frontline knowledge on these issues can help you craft a topic list that will have traction. Work together to define what is an admissions qualified lead (AQL). If you don't already have an &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/3-tips-to-perfect-handing-off-leads-between-marketing-and-admissions#sm.0015xvywb1ddif5ntr718nw3oll0i"&gt;service level agreement (SLA), 2017 is the year to put one together&lt;/a&gt; with your colleagues. It provides the framework for mutual support, open communication, and shared goals.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Stop posting just for the sake of posting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You have a blog to keep fresh and an extensive editorial calendar to execute! The drive to publish often leads to publishing whatever you can think of. But guess work is so 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You need to publish new posts regularly. &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogging-frequency-benchmarks#sm.0015xvywb1ddif5ntr718nw3oll0i"&gt;The more you publish blog posts, the more traffic and leads you drive to your website.&lt;/a&gt; Here's the critical caveat: are you attracting traffic and leads that fit your personas? You don't want just any old eyeballs. If you want to attract your ideal students and their parents, you must publish posts they actually want to read. You need to address their most pressing concerns, answer their burning questions, be a resource for the information they seek. Revisit your keyword research to reflect those burning questions, and what words they're using to ask them. Analyze your internal data to see which blog post topics are attracting the types of prospects you want. Freshen those up and use them as a starting point to brainstorm new post topics.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/use-blogging-to-attract-students-to-your-school"&gt;For more info on how to create content for schools check out -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; How to Use Blogging to Attract Students to Your School&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) It's not all about you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not that your school isn't fabulous. It is. But the hard truth is that most people aren't terribly interested in your school. Their single focus is making sure they get the best education for themselves or their kids. In the early stages of their enrollment journey, when they're researching, they only have a sketchy idea of what the "best education" means to them. Questions about their educational future are at a much higher level. Even when they've moved to their consideration and decision-making phases, their main interest is still: what about this school &lt;em&gt;suits&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, meets &lt;em&gt;my needs, will get me where I want to be&lt;/em&gt;. If you want people to continue to visit your blog or follow your school's social media profiles, the content there needs to provide pure value to prospects and their parents. It's not about you. It's about them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Stop relying entirely on the written word&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It's easy to think of blog posts as written articles, but what if you posted a video interview with someone from your career office on your blog? Or an infographic showing the breakdown of the collegiate and professional paths of your alumni?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Don't overlook video, podcasts, and other visual content. Infographics are liked and shared on social media 3x more than any other type of content. That's just &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-strategy#sm.0015xvywb1ddif5ntr718nw3oll0i"&gt;one jaw-dropping stat on the power images have in your content.&lt;/a&gt; People are also watching more digital video, especially video messaging apps like Facebook Messenger and Snapchat. Don't just think verbally. Think visually. Start with some of your best-performing written content and repurpose it into a visual format. That will give you a reason to promote both formats, so both the readers and the visual folks can connect with it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Do more on social&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Social engagement can't be an afterthought. It must be a strategic piece of your marketing plan. From deciding which social platforms to focus on (don't waste resources using them all), to determining how your school will use the different channels. Social media is a distribution channel that drives traffic back to your blog and landing pages. It can also be the delivery channel for your content, like your YouTube channel or Instagram account. It can also be the most direct, personal means you have to talk directly to your prospects, like Twitter. Specify each platform's role for your school so you're incorporating them effectively in the planning for all your campaigns and community-building activities.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) Keep learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The principles of inbound marketing never change. Build trust and credibility with your target personas by publishing awesome, informative content they can't ignore. The best strategies, tactics, and tools are another story. Options to try to new things, or using tools in new ways, is constantly growing. Keep reading your favorite marketing blogs (thank you very much!). You might even consider getting &lt;a href="http://academy.hubspot.com/certification-overview"&gt;inbound certified&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Work these resolutions into your planning for next quarter and next year. They'll become good habits soon enough. Then you can start working on your personal batch of resolutions. And our best wishes for a happy holiday season!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why You Need to Focus on Video Marketing in 2017 [Infographic]</title>

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;2016 saw a surge in the popularity of video as a content marketing format. From &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-video-marketing-examples"&gt;360-degree videos&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-live-video-examples"&gt;Facebook Live&lt;/a&gt;, marketers are responding to audiences' shorter attention spans by making content more interactive and visual -- and it's paying off.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Video is growing to dominate your audience's online activity: 78% of people watch videos online every week, and 55% watch videos online every &lt;em&gt;day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>3 Traits That Separate the Best Leaders from Average Ones</title>

        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-leader-traits" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/00-Blog_Thinkstock_Images/leadership-data.png?t=1483790613555" alt="3 Traits That Separate the Best Leaders from Average Ones" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The best leaders seem to possess an elusive mix of qualities that&amp;nbsp;resist precise categorization.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It feels like every week there's a new study or book&amp;nbsp;discussing what the best leaders do and don't do, but &lt;strong&gt;what if there was a more data-driven approach to identifying pivotal indicators of successful leadership?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The best leaders seem to possess an elusive mix of qualities that&amp;nbsp;resist precise categorization.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It feels like every week there's a new study or book&amp;nbsp;discussing what the best leaders do and don't do, but &lt;strong&gt;what if there was a more data-driven approach to identifying pivotal indicators of successful leadership?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;New data from &lt;a href="http://www.russellreynolds.com/"&gt;Russell Reynolds Associates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.hoganassessments.com/"&gt;Hogan Assessment Systems&lt;/a&gt; sheds some light on what separates the best leaders from average ones. By analyzing interviews, resumes, and multiple personality assessment questionnaires, researchers constructed in-depth psychometric profiles of 200 CEOs from around the world. They then validated the trends in an additional sample of 700 CEOs from Hogan's global database.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The final results, &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/how-the-best-ceos-differ-from-average-ones"&gt;published in Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt;, reveal three major indicators of successful CEOs.&amp;nbsp;Although there is no single perfect profile of a successful leader, the following qualities are usually associated with high-performing chief&amp;nbsp;executives. Check them out below to see where you stand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;3 Successful Leadership Indicators&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1) They have a strong sense of purpose, passion, and urgency.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The worst thing a CEO can do, according to &lt;a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/ceo-transitions-the-science-of-success"&gt;a related study on CEO transitions&lt;/a&gt; by McKinsey &amp;amp; Company, is "sit on their hands." The best CEOs move swiftly and decisively towards their personal and professional goals, never losing sight of their organization's core purpose or wavering in their&amp;nbsp;desire for change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Let's break these specific qualities down to examine each individually:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Purpose&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Think of purpose like an internal compass, guiding a leader's actions and keeping them focused on the big picture objectives that impact&amp;nbsp;their organization's bottom line. The best leaders&amp;nbsp;have an innate ability to understand how different components of their organizations contribute to long term goals, and they're comfortable taking ownership of those larger missions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Passion&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;How do you measure passion? It's tricky, but researchers found that leaders who worked towards their organizational goals with intensity and genuine excitement were more successful overall.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passion&amp;nbsp;keeps leaders personally invested in the success of their organizations.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;It helps foster a profound sense of ownership over the changes they initiate, and motivates them to nurture those initiatives with enthusiasm and conviction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Urgency&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Researchers found that urgency often manifested in successful CEOs as impatience and a consistent eagerness to drive progress. Most quality leaders are experts at mobilizing their teams, but &lt;strong&gt;the very best leaders are driven by a constant and deeply personal need to move things forward and seek new developments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They aren't satisfied with moving slowly or with too much caution -- they understand the importance of staying nimble and pushing their organizations towards transformative&amp;nbsp;change. It's important to note, however, that the best leaders&amp;nbsp;don't just make unreasonably impulsive decisions&amp;nbsp;-- they take &lt;em&gt;measured&lt;/em&gt; risks to move their organizations into the future&amp;nbsp;and keep ahead of the competition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;2) They know how to sift through information and find the most important parts.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Leaders are responsible for managing potentially overwhelming amounts of information on a daily basis. Their responsibilities are broad and widely varied, requiring them to simultaneously oversee a number of initiatives and projects without losing focus on their organization's core objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With so many moving parts to keep track of, &lt;strong&gt;leaders need to make tough decisions about what to prioritize&lt;/strong&gt;. And this requires an innate ability to sift through information and make firm, confident choices about how to move their organizations forward.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The most successful leaders have an elevated capacity to "separate the signal from the noise," as the Russell Reynolds Associates study &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/how-the-best-ceos-differ-from-average-ones"&gt;summarized it&lt;/a&gt;. "Great CEOs have a 'nose' for what are the most significant issues, challenges, threats, and opportunities facing an organization," Dean Stamoulis, the leader of Russell Reynolds Associates, &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/how-the-best-ceos-differ-from-average-ones"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in Harvard Business Review.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While it might seem like it sometimes, successful leaders don't exactly have a psychic power that enables them to make the best decisions -- but they do know how to examine many different sources of information and make clear, largely independent decisions they can proudly stand behind. &lt;strong&gt;The best leaders navigate the complex demands of their roles&amp;nbsp;with a heightened decisiveness that sets them apart from the pack.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;3) They are humble, always learning, and master collaborators.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This might conflict with the conventional view of the chief executive as an extroverted and wildly independent commander, but the Russell Reynolds Associates study &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/how-the-best-ceos-differ-from-average-ones"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that these leadership qualities were related to favorable organizational results.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The best leaders are more than capable of acting independently, but they are self-aware enough to know that they can't possibly know or do everything. To compensate for the gaps in their knowledge, they aren't afraid to turn to advisors and employees to seek new ideas and points of view. &lt;strong&gt;They are constantly in pursuit of the best new ideas, and they don't care if those ideas come from themselves or from someone else.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Coupled with this open mindedness is a desire to always be absorbing new information, honing new skills, and bettering their own abilities through constant learning. The best leaders are not content to operate solely on what they currently know -- they recognize that the demands of their position are always changing, and they need to better themselves to keep their organizations successful.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So what does constant learning look like? It's more than just reading new books and &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-podcasts-for-management"&gt;listening to podcasts&lt;/a&gt;. The most successful leaders learn from the people around them by engaging with projects at every level and surrounding themselves with people who aren't afraid to challenge even their most closely held ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It's this consistent intellectual immersion that keep leaders on their toes, forcing them to reevaluate, defend, and question what they know.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What traits do you look for in a leader?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tools-find-interview-remote-candidates" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Interviewing-Remote-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="17 of the Best Tools to Find and Interview Remote Candidates" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You donâ€™t know it yet, but you need &lt;i&gt;Kelsey&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sheâ€™s an ideal fit, the right mix of smarts and experience, temperament and personality. Sheâ€™s the missing link your department has been looking for, &lt;i&gt;needing&lt;/i&gt;. Thankfully, the need is mutual. Kelsey is looking for a job.&lt;/p&gt;
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Interviewing-Remote-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;height=302&amp;amp;name=Interviewing-Remote-compressor.jpg" alt="Interviewing-Remote-compressor.jpg" width="730" height="302"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You donâ€™t know it yet, but you need &lt;i&gt;Kelsey&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sheâ€™s an ideal fit, the right mix of smarts and experience, temperament and personality. Sheâ€™s the missing link your department has been looking for, &lt;i&gt;needing&lt;/i&gt;. Thankfully, the need is mutual. Kelsey is looking for a job.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you donâ€™t know Kelsey exists because she lives 1,691 miles away. And you probably never will because, right now, thereâ€™s a room full of candidates sitting outside your office, eager to impress in &lt;a href="http://blog.proven.com/how-to-interview"&gt;a face-to-face interview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Youâ€™d hire one of them before spending the time and money to source long-distance talent, right? It's more convenient, after all. Not to mention less expensive, less risky. Kelsey canâ€™t compete with that local, in-person pool &lt;i&gt;... right? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Wrong. Thereâ€™s a trove of online tools designed to help you easily find and confidently hire Kelsey. You just need to start&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;using them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;17 Tools to Find &amp;amp; Interview Remote Candidates&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If youâ€™re not sourcing talent outside of your zip code, then thatâ€™s too bad because your competitors are. Theyâ€™re using a variety of tools that streamline how they find and connect with candidates, specifically knowledge workers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Most of these tools fall under one of three categories:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic video conferencing tools&lt;/strong&gt;, which create authentic connections.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applicant tracking systems&lt;/strong&gt;, which automate the recruitment process.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical assessment platforms&lt;/strong&gt;, which test critical knowledge and skills.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Letâ€™s take a closer look ...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Basic Video Conferencing Tools&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I live in Chicago. My three nephews live in Maryland. Physically, weâ€™re hundreds of miles apart. But that reality, somehow, melts away as soon as my sister picks up my FaceTime call. Thatâ€™s when the boys rush in from every direction, vying for their piece of on-screen real estate, giggling through their gap-toothed smiles.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s a wonderful experience, warm and personal. It feels real, like Iâ€™m there with them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thatâ€™s what makes video calls so potent and powerful: &lt;i&gt;They help us forget weâ€™re not in-person. &lt;/i&gt;They cut through the distance. They put Kelsey on the same plane as all those in-person candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Use these tools to achieve an authentic connection with anyone, regardless of how many miles separate you:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;1) &lt;a href="https://hangouts.google.com/"&gt;Google Hangouts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Hangouts&lt;/strong&gt; is available to anyone with a Google account. Beautiful, simple, and intuitive, the Hangouts icon has become a standard fixture on desktops around the world. Your candidate will have it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4 style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/google-hangouts-screenshot.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=google-hangouts-screenshot.jpg" alt="google-hangouts-screenshot.jpg" width="669" title="google-hangouts-screenshot.jpg" style="width: 669px;"&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;2) &lt;a href="https://www.skype.com/en/"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skype &lt;/strong&gt;is proven. In addition to video chats, it can also be used to place high-quality global calls.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free. The â€œBusinessâ€ plan, however, runs around $2 per user per month.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/skype-screenshot.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;height=433&amp;amp;name=skype-screenshot.jpg" alt="skype-screenshot.jpg" width="669" height="433"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;3) &lt;a href="https://www.sparkhire.com/"&gt;Spark Hire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spark Hire &lt;/strong&gt;is like Google Hangouts or Skype, except you donâ€™t have to be present during the interview. The tool lets candidates record their video answers on their own time, while youâ€™re off in another meeting, or eating lunch, or sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You can then watch and evaluate on your time, when youâ€™re ready.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;$99 a month will get you started.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sparkhire-screenshot.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;height=418&amp;amp;name=sparkhire-screenshot.jpg" alt="sparkhire-screenshot.jpg" width="669" height="418"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;4) &lt;a href="http://www.vidcruiter.com/"&gt;VidCruiter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VidCruiter &lt;/strong&gt;can display your logo in the corner of the screen during a video interview, giving the process a professional, official veneer. The platform offers a variety of similar customizations that are simple to test and apply.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;Tailored to each customer, true to the platform itself.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/vidcruiter-screenshot.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;height=549&amp;amp;name=vidcruiter-screenshot.jpg" alt="vidcruiter-screenshot.jpg" width="669" height="549"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Applicant Tracking Systems&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hiring only one person can be a long, involved process. Hiring &lt;i&gt;many &lt;/i&gt;people, all at once, successfully, can be impossible. There are too many boxes to check, too many tasks to juggle. Youâ€™d need a team to make the process efficient and economical &lt;i&gt;... or would you?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An applicant tracking system, or ATS, is software that helps managers and recruiters streamline the hiring process by digitizing and automating essential hiring functions, like scheduling interviews or performing background checks.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An ATS can also be programed to crawl resumes and find great-fit candidates, like Kelsey. This will save you time and energy. There is no doubt it's a valuable tool, especially if youâ€™re hiring several positions at once.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Curious? Hereâ€™s our list of standout platforms:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;5) &lt;a href="http://www.jobvite.com/"&gt;Jobvite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jobvite&lt;/strong&gt;, like any ATS, does a lot. Itâ€™s a CRM. It performs crisp video interviews. It also sports a highly customizable interface thatâ€™ll give candidates an honest representation of your brand as they carve through the interview process.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;$500 per month for less than 100 employees plus a $1500 â€˜activation chargeâ€™ (which includes training).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;6) &lt;a href="http://hire.betterteam.com/"&gt;Betterteam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Betterteam &lt;/strong&gt;can automatically write your job ad for you. It can then post that ad to more than a hundred popular job boards and sites, like Glassdoor, Monster, CareerBuilder, and LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Want to add a job board to &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;website? Betterteam lets you do that, too. No coding skills necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;Free to start.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) &lt;a href="https://www.hirevue.com/"&gt;HireVue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HireVue&lt;/strong&gt; uses predictive analytics and machine learning to determine, for example, if an applicant will turnover quickly, among other invaluable tidbits. Also, if youâ€™re having trouble configuring one of the platformâ€™s many features, HireVueâ€™s paramount customer service will help you get back on your feet.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;The â€œOn-Siteâ€ package will run you $499 -- $899 for unlimited interviews per location. There are also â€œRecordedâ€ and â€œLiveâ€ packages.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hirevue-screenshot.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;height=545&amp;amp;name=hirevue-screenshot.jpg" alt="hirevue-screenshot.jpg" width="669" height="545" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;8) &lt;a href="https://www.homerun.co/"&gt;Homerun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homerun&lt;/strong&gt; lets you set up a dedicated career site that you can easily tailor to &lt;i&gt;perfectly &lt;/i&gt;reflect your brand and culture: Control every image and word, every font and color and form.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Unlike other platforms, Homerun lets companies categorically be themselves, a quality candidates will always recognize, even if theyâ€™re 1,691 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; â‚¬19 per active job opening per month, which is the â€œPay For What You Useâ€ plan.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/homerun-screenshot.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;height=435&amp;amp;name=homerun-screenshot.jpg" alt="homerun-screenshot.jpg" width="669" height="435" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;9) &lt;a href="http://www.hyrell.com/"&gt;Hyrell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyrell &lt;/strong&gt;has all the bells and whistles youâ€™d expect from an ATS: Easy interview scheduling, seamless communication features, job board posting, stellar account management, responsive technical support. Except Hyrell is optimized for franchise-based businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;Ranges between $200 - $800 per month. Thereâ€™s also an â€œEnterpriseâ€ package.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hyrell-screenshot.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;height=549&amp;amp;name=hyrell-screenshot.jpg" alt="hyrell-screenshot.jpg" width="669" height="549" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;10) &lt;a href="https://www.lever.co/"&gt;Lever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lever &lt;/strong&gt;helps companies source, interview, and hire â€œtop-tierâ€ talent, people who may not even be job hunting at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;Youâ€™ll have to contact Lever to get a custom quote, which, depending on the features, typically falls between $300 and $3,000.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/lever-screenshot.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;height=542&amp;amp;name=lever-screenshot.jpg" alt="lever-screenshot.jpg" width="669" height="542" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;11) &lt;a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/recruiter"&gt;LinkedIn Recruiter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LinkedIn Recruiter&lt;/strong&gt; leverages the networkâ€™s more than 400 million users -- along with premium features, like InMail and analytics tools -- to help you find the ideal person. You can also source from anywhere with Recruiter Mobile, a convenient app.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;It's $899.99 per month for the â€œCorporateâ€ plan. The â€œLiteâ€ version comes in at $239.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/LinkedIn%20Recruiter.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=LinkedIn%20Recruiter.png" alt="LinkedIn Recruiter.png" width="669" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;" title="LinkedIn Recruiter.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;12) &lt;a href="http://newtonsoftware.com/lp/a-1/?GA_network=g&amp;amp;GA_device=c&amp;amp;GA_campaign=680642572&amp;amp;GA_adgroup=33697341006&amp;amp;GA_target=&amp;amp;GA_placement=&amp;amp;GA_creative=153846082067&amp;amp;GA_extension=&amp;amp;GA_keyword=newton%20recruiting&amp;amp;GA_loc_physical_ms=9021715&amp;amp;GA_landingpage=http://newtonsoftware.com/lp/a-1/&amp;amp;_bm=e&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKEAiAsMXBBRD71KWOh6fcjRwSJAC5CNE1f6uErcTB3VyWZZ51JA4wNNAX-ZsFnszL9t9TB-pyIBoC_dTw_wcB"&gt;Newton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Newton &lt;/strong&gt;uses smart, decision-assistance tools to help small- and medium-sized organizations manage every stage of the hiring process. The platform also has a baked-in compliance feature that helps protect employers against fines and lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;The basic package will run you $399.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/newton-screenshot.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;height=549&amp;amp;name=newton-screenshot.jpg" alt="newton-screenshot.jpg" width="669" height="549" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;13) &lt;a href="http://www.proven.com/"&gt;Proven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proven &lt;/strong&gt;streamlines the hiring process for small businesses, letting you post a job ad to more than a hundred popular job board sites, then categorize your responses into buckets for quick, convenient reference.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Your first job ad is free. After that, you can pay-as-you-go for about $10 a pop.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/proven-screenshot.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;height=550&amp;amp;name=proven-screenshot.jpg" alt="proven-screenshot.jpg" width="669" height="550" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;The Technical Assessment Platforms&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kelsey, by the way, is a coder. A very good one, in fact. Based on her experience, you have every reason to believe her. But you canâ€™t know for sure until you test her ... live.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You could fly her in and go through the expensive motions: Airfare, lunch, hotel. Or you can send her a link and watch her work, in real time on your screen, as she takes your test remotely. The latter is easy thanks to these platforms:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;14) &lt;a href="https://coderpad.io/"&gt;CoderPad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CoderPad &lt;/strong&gt;lets you watch engineers code in real-time. It supports over 20 languages, including C/C++, Swift, Java, Ruby, and Python. The platform also allows you to playback an interview, stroke-for-stroke, so you can show others involved in the selection process.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Youâ€™ll pay $50 per month for a â€œPersonalâ€ account, which allows one user to conduct a maximum of 20 monthly interviews. The cost goes up from there.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/coderpad-screenshot.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;height=524&amp;amp;name=coderpad-screenshot.jpg" alt="coderpad-screenshot.jpg" width="730" height="524" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;15) &lt;a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/work"&gt;HackerRank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HackerRank &lt;/strong&gt;is rooted in crowdsourced coding competitions called &lt;i&gt;CodeChallenges&lt;/i&gt;, which you can post directly on your career page to attract candidates. You can also use the platform to run a &lt;i&gt;CodeSprint&lt;/i&gt;, which brings thousands of programmers together to compete in the same competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This process lets the best talent organically rise to the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;Youâ€™ll have to speak with sales after your 14-day free trial is up.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hackerrank-screenshot.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;height=550&amp;amp;name=hackerrank-screenshot.jpg" alt="hackerrank-screenshot.jpg" width="669" height="550" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;16) &lt;a href="https://www.interviewzen.com/"&gt;Interview Zen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interview Zen &lt;/strong&gt;lets you create open-ended coding interviews that are as unique and role-specific as necessary. Hereâ€™s an example from the site:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;Free.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/interviewzen-screenshot.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;height=544&amp;amp;name=interviewzen-screenshot.jpg" alt="interviewzen-screenshot.jpg" width="669" height="544"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;17) &lt;a href="https://codility.com/"&gt;Codility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Codility&lt;/strong&gt;, like the other tools on this list, will help you source, screen, and interview technical talent. But the platformâ€™s insightful and objective assessment scores help &lt;i&gt;non&lt;/i&gt;-technical recruiters make more informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Single users pay $159 monthly. Equipping multiple users, however, will require a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/codility-screenshot.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;height=544&amp;amp;name=codility-screenshot.jpg" alt="codility-screenshot.jpg" width="669" height="544" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;â€œHi, Kelsey,â€ you say, â€œhow was your flight?â€&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;â€œIt was quick and easy, thank you for asking,â€ she says, smiling. â€œItâ€™s so nice to finally meet you &lt;i&gt;in person&lt;/i&gt;.â€&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You smile back, eager to make her an offer.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;â€œI know,â€ you say, â€œit feels like I already know you.â€&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;To hit revenue and growth goals, your company needs customers. To get customers in an inbound world, your marketing team is responsible for generating leads and funneling them over to your sales team. The question is ... how &lt;em&gt;many &lt;/em&gt;leads?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When your boss asks you what your lead goal is, don't just pull an answer out of thin air. Your projections need to be based on math and rooted in your company's larger goals.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Establishing credibility isn't just about asserting your intelligence or expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Real credibility comes from a careful balance of trust, empathy, and good judgment. And it&amp;nbsp;needs to be attentively&amp;nbsp;nurtured throughout your client relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/00-Blog_Thinkstock_Images/credibility-killers.jpg?t=1483790613555"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Establishing credibility isn't just about asserting your intelligence or expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Real credibility comes from a careful balance of trust, empathy, and good judgment. And it&amp;nbsp;needs to be attentively&amp;nbsp;nurtured throughout your client relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To help you avoid unintentionally damaging your credibility, we've compiled a list of six seemingly harmless phrases that can undermine your credibility and communicate to the client that you aren't fully on their team.&amp;nbsp;Are you guilty of using any of these?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;6 Phrases that Kill Your Credibility with Clients&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1) "This tactic is &lt;em&gt;guaranteed&lt;/em&gt; to boost your conversion rate by 60%."&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Avoid exaggerating or overselling the successes of your services -- your clients can smell insincerity a mile away, and it's sure to turn them off. &lt;strong&gt;Presenting them with inflated numbers or unrealistic claims won't boost your credibility&lt;/strong&gt;, it will make them question whether you can provide any honest&amp;nbsp;value to their business.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Remember: there's confidence, and then there's just plain bragging. Your clients only care about your past successes in the context of how they can directly provide value now, so avoid reading off a laundry list of accomplishments or stats. &lt;strong&gt;It can come across as self-serving and out of touch with the client's specific needs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Even if you're not overtly exaggerating, be sure to cut out lofty words like "guaranteed," or "absolutely." These can come across as deceptive and pushy, and fail to communicate what your agency can actually do.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on explaining the genuine value of your agency's services.&lt;/strong&gt; If you highlight a few proven strengths, rather than a showy list of claims, your client will be more likely trust your expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;2) "Sorry I couldn't get that to you by Wednesday -- something came up."&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When your actions don't align with your words, you end up falling into what &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2012/07/recover-your-credibility"&gt;Prasad Kaipa calls a "Credibility Gap."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Avoiding the Credibility Gap starts with &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/managing-client-expectations"&gt;setting realistic expectations&lt;/a&gt; and time lines&amp;nbsp;on projects, and keeping an open line of communication to alert your clients if anything goes wrong or takes an unexpected turn.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kaipa &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2012/07/recover-your-credibility"&gt;explains to Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;strong&gt;the best way to set realistic expectations is to be more aware of what you're promising&lt;/strong&gt;. He recommends checking in with yourself regularly and asking, "Am I saying something that implies a promise? What are the odds I can or will actually follow through? How can I articulate my ideas and concerns in such a way as to not raise false expectations?"&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you realize too late that a deadline isn't feasible, don't freak out. It's not unusual for &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/project-management-mistakes-avoid"&gt;unanticipated issues to arise&lt;/a&gt; during the course of a project, but as long as you remain transparent and clearly communicate the issues to your clients, your credibility isn't likely to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;3) "We call this marketing approach 'Infrared Magical Marketing Synthesis,' or IMMS."&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Credibility requires clear and accessible communication, and nothing undermines this more than an overuse of jargon or acronyms. Overcomplicated words and insider phrases don't help you connect with your client -- &lt;strong&gt;they create barriers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;People often unknowingly fall back on jargon when they want to &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2011/12/business-jargon-is-not-a-value"&gt;sound clever or informed&lt;/a&gt;, but in reality, it can end up hurting your credibility much more than it helps.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you rely too heavily on jargon to convey information, &lt;strong&gt;it can diminish the meaning of your message and cause unnecessary confusion&lt;/strong&gt;. Even worse, it has the potential to isolate your client and make them feel like an outsider in your discussions. Using too much jargon can also come across as evasive -- like you're unwilling or incapable of giving clients a simple, straightforward answer.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before meeting with a client, comb through your presentation and eliminate any jargon-heavy words or acronyms that don't actively contribute to your message. Your clients will appreciate the directness of your communication style, and &lt;strong&gt;will likely be more receptive to what you have to say.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;4) "Although the numbers look bad now, this tactic has actually worked for many of our other clients."&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ignoring or glossing over factual evidence in favor of selective, anecdotal evidence isn't just a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking"&gt;rhetorical fallacy&lt;/a&gt;, it's also a major credibility killer.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The client hired you because you have expertise they think can benefit their business, and that means &lt;strong&gt;admitting when an approach isn't performing as well as planned &lt;/strong&gt;and pivoting towards something with more potential. When you scrounge around for evidence that supports a not-so-great approach as a way to salvage it, you end up falling victim to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias"&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Confirmation bias occurs when you interpret all evidence -- even ambiguous or anecdotal evidence -- as confirmation of your preexisting beliefs. This can cause you to problematically overlook alternative possibilities that could benefit the client more than the current approach. In other words, &lt;strong&gt;you get so focused on pushing a particular strategy that you fail to see any real evidence against it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid confirmation bias and keep your credibility intact is to focus on new evidence as objectively as possible, and prove the value of your work &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/agency-data-approach"&gt;through clear reporting&lt;/a&gt;. If you're scrambling to justify a particular tactic, it's might be time to let it go, rather than damage your credibility attempting to defend it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;5) "I just don't think that approach is going to work."&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Anyone who's ever worked in a people-facing role knows how challenging it can be to always see eye-to-eye with clients -- especially when you feel like you're caught in a cycle of endless revisions that never seem to make them happy. You want to make sure your professional opinion is properly asserted, but &lt;strong&gt;it's important to know when to step back defer to your client's judgment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you get in the habit of shooting down your client's input or ideas, they'll start to think you haven't taken the time to fully consider their point of view. Pushing back without proper justification can make you seem reactive and unthoughtful -- and that undermines your credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to establish your expertise and make your client feel comfortable and respected is to know when you don't have the best answer, and let your client make the final call.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;6) "Does that make sense?"&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This seemingly innocuous phrase has the potential to be so damaging to your credibility that Jerry Weissman, a leading corporate presentations coach, has written a whole &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2011/09/never-ask-does-that-make-sense"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on it in Harvard Business Review.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you follow up a presentation or assertion with, "Does that make sense?" it has two negative implications, &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2011/09/never-ask-does-that-make-sense"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to Weissman:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt; on the part of the speaker about the accuracy or credibility of the content.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doubt&lt;/strong&gt; about the ability of the audience to comprehend or appreciate the content.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not only does this phrase make it seem like you're unsure what you're talking about, it also calls into question the competence of your client -- which isn't a great way to build a positive relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissman &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2011/09/never-ask-does-that-make-sense"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; a switch to "Do you have any questions?" to avoid the negative connotations of this phrase.&lt;/strong&gt; It's a simple switch that can save your credibility from taking a hit at your next client meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What phrases do you avoid using with clients? Let us know in the comments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This year, we've seen the importance of visual content emphasized by the changes that occurred across almost every major social network, including Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. At the same time, videos have become powerful tools for brands looking to communicate more easily with their readers.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;42 Stats You Should Know About Visual Content Marketing in 2017&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;General Visual Content Statistics&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;1) 37% of marketers said visual marketing was the most important form of content for their business, second only to blogging (38%). &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SocialMediaMarketingIndustryReport2016.pdf"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;2) 74% of social media marketers use visual assets in their social media marketing, ahead of blogs (68%) and videos (60%). &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SocialMediaMarketingIndustryReport2016.pdf"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;3) When people hear information, they're likely to remember only 10% of that information three days later. However, if a relevant image is paired with that same information, people retained 65% of the information three days later. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.brainrules.net/vision"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h4&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;11) More than 60% of marketers and small business owners said they planned to increase investment in video marketing in 2017. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;  (&lt;a href="https://animoto.com/blog/business/2016-social-video-forecast-infographic/"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h4&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Most people don't relish the thought of&amp;nbsp;receiving&amp;nbsp;negative feedback about their work, but that doesn't mean it can't be highly beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In fact, in a survey of nearly 1,000 employees, &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2014/01/your-employees-want-the-negative-feedback-you-hate-to-give"&gt;Zenger/Folkman&lt;/a&gt; found that more than half preferred corrective feedback over praise, and 72% believed that their performance would improve with the help of constructive criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/negative-feedback-management-tips#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;Feedback&lt;/a&gt; can be beneficial to improving your work, but there are definitely right and wrong ways to &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/peer-feedback-tips#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;deliver&lt;/a&gt; and receive that feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To get to the root of it, the folks at &lt;a href="https://venngage.com/blog/negative-feedback/"&gt;Venngage&lt;/a&gt; conducted a survey of 57 &lt;a href="http://www.inbound.com/"&gt;INBOUND&lt;/a&gt; 2016 speakers from a variety of organizations and industries. They asked these experts how they handled negative feedback from their particular&amp;nbsp;stakeholders, such as customers, readers, managers, and peers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;How much time do you spend on email each week?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/christinecrandell/2015/08/26/adobe-study-finds-email-is-an-addiction/#ced7a5542389"&gt;recent survey from Adobe&lt;/a&gt;, the average American professional spends about six hours a day checking email -- &lt;strong&gt;that's 30 hours during the work week&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That's a lot of time spent on unbillable tasks that could be spent focusing on work that meets the goals of your paying clients.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Getting bogged down by your inbox is especially problematic in agencies where account managers and other client-facing employees must deal with managing requests from a number of different clients who are all considered priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you communicate with your clients primarily over email, it's easy for important messages and tasks to get lost in the seemingly constant shuffle. Your inbox can quickly become an unmanageable time sink.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You could use a &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/agency-project-management-tools"&gt;project management tool&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the amount of email clutter created from projects. But &lt;strong&gt;you could also better optimize how you use email, prioritize requests, manage communication from your inbox.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Check out these 13 Gmail plugins and apps to start improving how you use email to communicate and collaborate with clients.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;13 Tools to Improve Client Communication &amp;amp; Collaboration Through Email&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1)&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.sanebox.com/"&gt;SaneBox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;SaneBox weeds out unimportant emails after examining your inbox content and history, surfacing only the communications you want to priortize. You can train the tool by moving miscategorized emails to&amp;nbsp;your inbox to make it even smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The tool also provides features for setting notifications for when people don't reply to a message, unsubscribing from unwanted newsletters, and snoozing emails you want to deal with later.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/Blog_Images/sanebox-folders.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=690&amp;amp;height=556&amp;amp;name=sanebox-folders.png" alt="sanebox-folders.png" title="sanebox-folders.png" width="690" height="556" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Snack&lt;/em&gt; plan for&amp;nbsp;$7&lt;span&gt;/month for annual contract, &lt;em&gt;Lunch&lt;/em&gt; plan for $12/month for annual contract, &lt;em&gt;Dinner&lt;/em&gt; plan for $36/month for annual contract&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;2)&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/just-not-sorry-the-gmail/fmegmibednnlgojepmidhlhpjbppmlci?hl=en-US"&gt;Just Not Sorry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Communicating with clients in a direct, assertive manner is easier said than done. This plugin helps you write more confident emails by scanning your messages for extraneous words that undermine your tone, e.g., "Sorry," "Just," or "I think."&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you use a word or phrase in an email that could potentially weaken your positioning, the app highlights it and explains specifically how it could make you seem less confident and proficient.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/just-not-sorry.png?t=1483790613555" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;3)&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://mailburn.com/"&gt;Mailburn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This iPhone app upgrades the user interface of your email client by displaying emails as chat dialogues. It also separates newsletters from emails from people in your inbox, and provides an option for you to unsubscribe to irrelevant communications with one swipe -- perfect for decluttering your inbox. The app works with both Gmail and Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/Blog_Images/mailburn.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=450&amp;amp;name=mailburn.png" alt="mailburn.png" title="mailburn.png" width="450" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 450px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/Blog_Images/mailburn-newsletter.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=450&amp;amp;name=mailburn-newsletter.png" alt="mailburn-newsletter.png" title="mailburn-newsletter.png" width="450" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 450px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;4)&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.getsidekick.com/"&gt;HubSpot Sales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HubSpot Sales is a free&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm/email-tracking"&gt;email tracking&lt;/a&gt; tool that allows you to see when a client or prospect&amp;nbsp;has opened an email -- basically, you'll&amp;nbsp;be able to tell if your email got lost in the client's inbox or if she's actually ignoring it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The plugin also highlights key contact information about the person you are emailing, such as links to their social profiles, so you can gather intel on what the person is interested in or recent events in their professional life and personalize your messages. With HubSpot Sales pro, you can create up to 1,000 templates&amp;nbsp;and track the performance of your sent emails and content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/hubspot-sales-gmail.png?t=1483790613555" style="width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Free, Sales Pro is $50/user/month&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;5)&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://yanado.com/"&gt;Yanado&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You don't want to be controlled by your inbox, but it's also the place where many of your important task items and communication about these items are located.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This plugin&amp;nbsp;brings your to-do list to your inbox to make prioritizing&amp;nbsp;and organization more streamlined. There's no need to hop from your email to your to-do list to your project management tool and back. It's all there in one straightforward&amp;nbsp;interface.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/Blog_Images/yanado.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=yanado.png" alt="yanado.png" title="yanado.png" width="669" style="width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Free&lt;/em&gt; plan for one user, &lt;em&gt;Startup&lt;/em&gt; plan $6/user/month for up to 100 users, &lt;em&gt;Premium&lt;/em&gt; plan $15/user/month up to 1000 users, &lt;em&gt;Enterprise&lt;/em&gt; plan pricing available upon request&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;6)&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://snapmail.co/"&gt;Snapmail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Snapmail is perfect for when you need to send a vendor or a client password details and other sensitive information, but you don't want it to sit in their inbox and potentially cause a security risk. You simply select the Snapmail&amp;nbsp;button, and any text emails will be encrypted. Once your&amp;nbsp;recipient opens the email, she will have 60 seconds to record the content before it's gone for good.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/Blog_Images/snapmail.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=598&amp;amp;height=399&amp;amp;name=snapmail.png" alt="snapmail.png" title="snapmail.png" width="598" height="399" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;7)&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://unroll.me/"&gt;Unroll.me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To focus only on the really important emails&amp;nbsp;-- like those from your clients -- it's a good practice to unsubscribe&amp;nbsp;from the email newsletters that are no longer relevant or those that you've been mysteriously&amp;nbsp;added to.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With Unroll.me, you can easily view&amp;nbsp;your subscription lists and unsubscribe from them with one-click. You can also choose to "roll up" your subscriptions into a digest email to reduce email clutter and distractions throughout the day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/Blog_Images/unroll.me-unsubscribe.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=unroll.me-unsubscribe.png" alt="unroll.me-unsubscribe.png" title="unroll.me-unsubscribe.png" width="669" style="width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;8)&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://en.todoist.com/"&gt;Todoist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This app allows you to instantly convert messages in your Gmail or Outlook inbox into tasks for your to-do list, and automatically syncs across all of your devices. You can also assign tasks to other members of your team, collaborate on tasks, and set deadlines and reminders to stay on track.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you install the plugin for Gmail, it creates a tab to access your to-do list within your inbox, so you don't have to download another program to view your list.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/todoist-app.png?t=1483790613555" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Basic&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is Free, &lt;em&gt;Premium&lt;/em&gt; (for individuals) is $28.99/year, &lt;em&gt;Business&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(for teams) is $28.99/year/per user&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;9)&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.batchedinbox.com/"&gt;Batched&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It &lt;a href="https://www.atlassian.com/time-wasting-at-work-infographic"&gt;takes 16 minutes to refocus after handling an email&lt;/a&gt;, and on average, employees check their email 36 times per hour. How can you get anything productive done with a tool that constantly distracts you?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Batched lets you control when emails reach your inbox, which is especially useful when you need to focus and get a project out before a deadline. Basically, the tool filters emails under a specific label in your Gmail account. At times that you have selected (such as every hour or at 9 a.m., 2 p.m., and 4:30 p.m.), those emails are moved to your inbox. You always have access to any important incoming emails, but you can stem the habit of checking email out of curiousity&amp;nbsp;that something important has arrived.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/Blog_Images/batched-email-hide.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=336&amp;amp;height=491&amp;amp;name=batched-email-hide.png" alt="batched-email-hide.png" title="batched-email-hide.png" width="336" height="491" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;10) &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-spell-checker-g/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en"&gt;Grammarly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;You need your clients to trust you, and building trust is all about proving to your client that you're an expert in your field. And experts don't forget about grammar. They know the that only amateurs (not &lt;em&gt;amatures&lt;/em&gt;) dash off an email without clicking spellcheck.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Grammarly works wherever you're writing online -- email, in a project management system, or a blogging platform -- and makes sure that your credibility remains in tact by double-checking your work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/Blog_Images/grammarly.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=636&amp;amp;height=400&amp;amp;name=grammarly.png" alt="grammarly.png" title="grammarly.png" width="636" height="400" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Free basic plan, &lt;em&gt;Premium&lt;/em&gt; plan&amp;nbsp;available on monthly basis for $29.95/month, quarterly basis for $19.98/month, and annual basis for $11.66/month&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;11)&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/checker-plus-for-gmail/oeopbcgkkoapgobdbedcemjljbihmemj?hl=en"&gt;Checker Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you want to know when you've received an important email from a client or manager without constantly opening up Gmail, this app allows you to set up Chrome notifications for important conversations, ensuring you never miss an important message.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The app also allows you to go on "Do Not Disturb" mode when you're trying to get work done, and lets you mark unimportant messages as "Read" without even opening up Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/checker-plus.png?t=1483790613555" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;12)&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keyrocket-for-gmail/dmocchgkijnbjdjkmlglaemjhhdiobbp?hl=en"&gt;KeyRocket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This plugin teaches you how to use all of Gmail's built-in hotkeys so you can more efficiently manage your inbox with fewer clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you take an action in Gmail that could have been accomplished via a hotkey action (e.g., composing a new message), KeyRocket triggers a simple notification that lets you know the hotkey option you could have used.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We all stumble across a word, phrase, or reference we don't quite understand every once in a while. This plugin lets you double click on any word in an email and instantly look up the meaning or Wikipedia explanation -- without having to leave the compose window.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fonts &amp; Feelings: Does Typography Connote Emotions?</title>

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Think about your favorite book for a moment. How did it make you feel when you read it? Is that part of what made it such a compelling story?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My favorite book series is &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter"&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and apart from the awesomeness that is a magical boarding school, the font in which it was published may have influenced&lt;span&gt; my affection for the series.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Think about your favorite book for a moment. How did it make you feel when you read it? Is that part of what made it such a compelling story?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My favorite book series is &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter"&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and apart from the awesomeness that is a magical boarding school, the font in which it was published may have influenced&lt;span&gt; my affection for the series.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You see, &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-strategy?_ga=1.135209591.7546083.1477915232#sm.00001jv8k2j9vzembr7434ir2v3u3"&gt;visual elements&lt;/a&gt; are just as important as the words on a web page or blog post. And &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/choosing-fonts-guide#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;fonts&lt;/a&gt; serve as a visual marketing tool for publishers to leverage when compiling their story. The &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/28-free-fonts-beautify-content#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;font you choose&lt;/a&gt; ultimately plays a hand in conveying the message you want to send your readers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In this post, weâ€™ll explore how fonts can influence reader emotion and how marketers can use this information in their content.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Fonts vs. Typefaces: Whatâ€™s the Difference?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;â€œFontâ€ and â€œtypefaceâ€ are two terms that are often incorrectly used interchangeably.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A font&lt;/strong&gt; is one particular weight and style of a larger &lt;strong&gt;typeface&lt;/strong&gt;. Typefaces are categories comprised of many different fonts. For example, Serif is a typeface, and Times New Roman is a font that is part of the Serif family.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are a variety of different &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/choosing-fonts-guide#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;typefaces and fonts&lt;/a&gt;. Hereâ€™s a quick rundown:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Serif&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Serif fonts are identifiable by the small lines on the edges of letters (called serifs) that make the font easier to read in print.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fonts in the Serif typeface include Times New Roman, Georgia, and Book Antiqua.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Sans Serif&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sans serif font letters donâ€™t have a serif attached to them, so they display more clearly on websites.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fonts in the Sans serif typeface include Arial, Verdana, and Helvetica.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hereâ€™s a diagram of the difference between Serif and Sans Serif:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/serif-1.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=648&amp;amp;height=328&amp;amp;name=serif-1.png" alt="serif-1.png" width="648" height="328" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;Script&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fonts in the Script typeface are meant to imitate the fluidity of human handwriting.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fonts in the Script typeface include Comic Sans, Kristen, and Lucida.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hereâ€™s an example of Kristen below:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/kristen_itc_normal_font_preview_characters.gif?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=kristen_itc_normal_font_preview_characters.gif" alt="kristen_itc_normal_font_preview_characters.gif" width="669" title="kristen_itc_normal_font_preview_characters.gif" style="width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Source: &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fontsplace.com/kristen-itc-normal-free-font-download.html"&gt;FontsPlace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Modern or Display&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The modern typeface is characterized by variance between thin and thick bold lines in the lettering.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fonts in the Modern typeface include Impact, Rockwell, and Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hereâ€™s an example of the Impact font:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/impact.gif?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;name=impact.gif" alt="impact.gif" width="640" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 640px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Source: &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fontco.com/font-facts/impact.php"&gt;FontCo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Monospaced&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Monospaced fonts have larger spaces between each letter and were designed to look like text was written using a typewriter.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fonts in the Monospaced typeface include Courier, Consolas, and Monaco.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hereâ€™s what Courier looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/fonts_sample_courier_new.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;name=fonts_sample_courier_new.png" alt="fonts_sample_courier_new.png" width="640" style="width: 640px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Source: &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prepressure.com/fonts/interesting/courier"&gt;PrePressure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These different typefaces and fonts are widely used across the internet, and research has been conducted about the impact of fonts on communication and overall perception. Letâ€™s dive into the data and see if you agree with their findings.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Which Fonts Connote Which Emotions?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Wichita State Universityâ€™s Software Usability Research Laboratory &lt;a href="http://usabilitynews.org/perception-of-fonts-perceived-personality-traits-and-uses/"&gt;conducted a survey&lt;/a&gt; in 2006 to determine if different fonts had different emotions and personalities associated with them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the survey, they asked more than 500 participants about their perceptions of a variety of different fonts across the typefaces outlined above. The fonts that respondents answered questions about were:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/fonts_study.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=609&amp;amp;height=211&amp;amp;name=fonts_study.png" alt="fonts_study.png" width="609" height="211" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Source: &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://usabilitynews.org/perception-of-fonts-perceived-personality-traits-and-uses/"&gt;UsabilityNews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Different uses of each font were evaluated in the survey, such as emails, letters, spreadsheets, web pages, headlines, and news articles.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Respondents were then asked to assign personalities and emotions to each font, and the results were organized according to personality factors that the different fonts shared most frequently. The fonts within specific typefaces ended up grouping together, as you can see in the diagram below:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/POF5.gif?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=576&amp;amp;height=133&amp;amp;name=POF5.gif" alt="POF5.gif" width="576" height="133" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Source: &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://usabilitynews.org/perception-of-fonts-perceived-personality-traits-and-uses/"&gt;UsabilityNews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The study then produced a detailed breakdown of the fonts most commonly associated with both positive and negative emotions and personality traits. The results are intriguing:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serif &lt;/strong&gt;fonts were rated as â€œstable,â€ â€œpractical,â€ and â€œmature.â€&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sans serif &lt;/strong&gt;fonts didnâ€™t receive any particularly positive or negative personality associations.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Script fonts&lt;/strong&gt; were perceived as â€œfeminine,â€ â€œfunny,â€ and â€œcasual.â€&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern fonts&lt;/strong&gt; were categorized as â€œmasculine,â€ â€œassertive,â€ and â€œcoarse.â€&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monospaced &lt;/strong&gt;fonts were called â€œdull,â€ â€œplain,â€ and â€œunimaginative.â€&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hereâ€™s the full breakdown of the top three fonts for each emotion and personality trait in the survey:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/POF6.gif?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=573&amp;amp;height=792&amp;amp;name=POF6.gif" alt="POF6.gif" width="573" height="792" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Source: &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://usabilitynews.org/perception-of-fonts-perceived-personality-traits-and-uses/"&gt;UsabilityNews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While that study provided some interesting insight around the way people view specific fonts, there are numerous other studies and theories that point to why certain fonts connote specific emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For example, in &lt;a href="http://www.pec-journal.com/article/S0738-3991(14)00478-9/abstract?rss=yes"&gt;a 2014 study&lt;/a&gt;, medical patients received the same set of at-home care instructions in different fonts, and the harder-to-read fonts made patients think the tasks were harder to do. This is an example of &lt;strong&gt;cognitive fluency&lt;/strong&gt;, a theory that posits when our brains have difficulty processing information, the task at hand appear more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Similarly, a &lt;a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/780/docs/08_ps_song___schwarz_effort.pdf"&gt;2008 study&lt;/a&gt;, in which participants were presented exercise instructions in hard-to-read fonts, revealed that the challenging font choice made the task seem to require more time to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The lesson? Based on cognitive fluency, if something is easy to read, it also seems &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-recipe-for-motivation/"&gt;easy to do&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But that's not all. The &lt;strong&gt;semantic memory&lt;/strong&gt; associated with fonts also &lt;a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/blog/font-psychology/"&gt;influences how readers feel&lt;/a&gt; about the fonts and the content theyâ€™re reading. For example, the Helvetica font is used on United States tax and Internal Revenue Service forms, which influences how the font is perceived -- depending on their experience with the federal tax system.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All of this is to say that there are numerous theories surrounding the psychology and emotional response to different fonts. In marketing specifically, &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/how-to-choose-fonts-for-marketing"&gt;fonts&lt;/a&gt; can capture your audienceâ€™s attention and help reinforce your brandâ€™s messaging, so letâ€™s dive into some actionable takeaways for content marketers getting ready to type.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;3 Takeaways for Selecting Fonts to Use in Your Marketing&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1) Choose fonts strategically by focusing on readability and legibility.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/infographic/what-font-best-you-81516268"&gt;Creative Bloq&lt;/a&gt; created an infographic that outlines many factors to consider when &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/choosing-fonts-guide#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;choosing fonts&lt;/a&gt; for different projects, and they found a few trends in which fonts are widely used specifically among blogs:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;20% of blogs use &lt;span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;"&gt;Georgia (Serif) for header text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;10% of blogs use &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/oswald.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=45&amp;amp;height=18&amp;amp;name=oswald.png" alt="oswald.png" width="45" height="18"&gt; (Sans serif) for header text&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;10% of blogs use &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/oswald.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=45&amp;amp;height=18&amp;amp;name=oswald.png" alt="oswald.png" width="45" height="18" style="margin: 1px 0px 0px;"&gt; (Sans serif) for header text&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;20% of blogs use &lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"&gt;Arial (Sans serif) for blog body copy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;10% of blogs use &lt;span style="font-family: helvetica;"&gt;Helvetica (Sans serif) for blog body copy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sans serif fonts are particularly clear to readers: Without the serifs on the lettering, Sans serif fonts like Arial are easy to read even on small screens, where users are &lt;a href="https://adwords.googleblog.com/2015/05/building-for-next-moment.html"&gt;spending a lot of time online&lt;/a&gt; these days.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Based on the research, fonts on your web pages and blog posts should be clear and easy-to-read. In fact, the simpler the better -- that way, articles will be readable on a variety of different screen sizes, and your content wonâ€™t be associated with difficulty or inconvenience. Below, you can see that &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt; publishes articles in Proxima Nova, a Sans serif font that is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.typewolf.com/blog/most-popular-fonts-of-the-year"&gt;most popular fonts&lt;/a&gt; among internet publications.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/the%20atlantic_font.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=the%20atlantic_font.png" alt="the atlantic_font.png" width="669" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;" title="the atlantic_font.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Source: &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/12/gift-guide-2016/509546/"&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://fount.artequalswork.com/"&gt;Fount&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;2) Use typography that communicates to visitors who youâ€™re looking for.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If your goals include &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/the-benefits-of-business-blogging-ht"&gt;attracting&lt;/a&gt; a broad audience to your website, use typography that makes your content as universal and accessible as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if your content is meant to communicate particular emotions and messaging, you can communicate that with your font choices.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For example, childish, playful fonts like those in the Script typeface may be the right fit for childrenâ€™s clothing websites. Below, you can see that a Serif font was the right choice for &lt;i&gt;Pottermore&lt;/i&gt; -- it makes readers remember the classic Serif font used in the &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/i&gt; books themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pottermore%20font.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;height=77&amp;amp;name=pottermore%20font.png" alt="pottermore font.png" width="730" height="77"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Source: &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pottermore.com/"&gt;Pottermore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/"&gt;Fount&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;3) Remember: Things seem easier to do when theyâ€™re easier to read.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Make sure that fonts for your calls-to-action, headlines, and landing pages are bold, clear, and motivate site visitors to &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/executive-guide-effective-lead-nurturing"&gt;fulfill the task&lt;/a&gt; you want them to with your content. Here at HubSpot, we used a clear Sans serif font for our homepage and calls-to-action to make the information crystal clear to site visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hubspot%20proxima%20nova.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;height=256&amp;amp;name=hubspot%20proxima%20nova.png" alt="hubspot proxima nova.png" width="730" height="256"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Source: &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/"&gt;HubSpot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/"&gt;Fount&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The visual elements on a web page are just as important as the content youâ€™re writing about, so experiment with different fonts that send the right message and elicit the feelings you want from your audience.

        &lt;p&gt;2016 brought change the marketing industry in many ways -- from powerful innovations to continuously evolving mediums.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But digital marketers know that change happens frequently in our industry, and adaptability is key to continue driving results in the face of burgeoning &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-marketing-statistics#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;trends&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-28/snapchat-user-content-fuels-jump-to-10-billion-daily-video-views"&gt;growing social networks&lt;/a&gt;, and new, &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/emotion-detection-technology-marketing#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;advanced technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Now that we've rung in the&amp;nbsp;New Year here at HubSpot, we wanted to remember the biggest changes that happened in the world of social media marketing in 2016. That's why we made a short video -- &lt;a href="http://digiday.com/platforms/silent-world-facebook-video/"&gt;sound not required&lt;/a&gt;, of course -- to review it all.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;From all of us at HubSpot, Happy New Year! Thanks for sticking with us through all the change. Now let's keep the 2017 conversation going by sharing this video on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Build Self-Confidence After a Bad Month: 8 Helpful Tips</title>

        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/build-self-confidence-after-bad-month" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Regaining-Confidence-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="How to Build Self-Confidence After a Bad Month: 8 Helpful Tips" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you've had a really bad day, the last thing you want to do is spend the night figuring out how to rebuild for the next.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, imagine if it were an entire month. Your energy is sapped. You might even feel defeated. And the last thing you feel is confident. Getting up and trying again seems like an ordeal -- one that requires a lot more effort than you feel like making. But you have to.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Regaining-Confidence-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=761&amp;amp;name=Regaining-Confidence-compressor.jpg" alt="Regaining-Confidence-compressor.jpg" width="761" title="Regaining-Confidence-compressor.jpg" style="width: 761px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you've had a really bad day, the last thing you want to do is spend the night figuring out how to rebuild for the next.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, imagine if it were an entire month. Your energy is sapped. You might even feel defeated. And the last thing you feel is confident. Getting up and trying again seems like an ordeal -- one that requires a lot more effort than you feel like making. But you have to.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When we've experienced a prolonged period of negative events, one of the biggest challenges is regaining your personal morale to go back and give it another shot. That's true of dating, and it's true of negative fallbacks at work. We're here to discuss the latter -- and we've got some ideas for how you can get your professional groove back.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="cta_button" href="https://offers.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=e8229fac-5f6a-4a3f-a00d-f698a90c991f&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid="&gt; &lt;img class="hs-cta-img " style="border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; " alt="Download our complete productivity guide here for more tips on improving your  productivity at work." src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/e8229fac-5f6a-4a3f-a00d-f698a90c991f.png"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So if you've had a tough month and you're not feeling so positive, chin up -- we've got a whole collection of tips to get you back on your feet.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;8 Tips for Rebuilding Self-Confidence After a Bad Month&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1) Talk to your manager.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We are a society that's afraid of looking weak, and it has a bad impact on our behavior. It makes &lt;a href="http://cdn-care.com/img/cms/web/infographics/caredotcom-working-moms-stress-infographic.jpg"&gt;29% of us reluctant to ask for help at home&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/opinion/sunday/is-your-boss-mean.html"&gt;40% of us afraid to be nice at work&lt;/a&gt; -- because we fear that people will take advantage of us.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It makes sense, then, that &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/guilt-sabotage-work#sm.0000e1w1nuwvbeo5sq61j1tim2kyj"&gt;many of us are afraid to ask for help at work&lt;/a&gt; for fear of looking foolish or ill-informed. Not only can that lead to making mistakes in the first place, but it can also leave you without the necessary information to avoid them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Let your boss know that you recognize where things have fallen short, and ask for specific feedback. Chances are, your manager will appreciate your proactive attitude about mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;2) Ask what â€œbadâ€ means to you, compared to reality.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"I'm my own worst critic." It's something that many of us say, since we expect perfection from ourselves, which starts at an alarmingly young age. In one study of children in Singapore, researchers found that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/06/27/dear-tiger-mom-your-perfectionist-parenting-style-may-be-detrimental-to-your-child/?utm_term=.2f623c48d4a5"&gt;60% scored remarkably high on "self-criticalness," with 78% scoring high in "socially prescribed perfectionism." And more than half -- 59% -- were reported to have both&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yikes. With such a perfectionism epidemic, we wouldnâ€™t be surprised if youâ€™re perceiving your â€œbadâ€ month to be worse than it actually was.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thatâ€™s another place where talking to someone else about it -- like your manager -- can help to put things into perspective. Personally, I have a tendency to assume the absolute worst about everything, especially when it comes to mistakes at work.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But as soon as I bring it up with a colleague or my boss, one of three things usually happen:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;It turns out to be a first-time mistake that everyone makes.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Itâ€™s easy to fix.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Itâ€™s really not that big of a deal.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When weâ€™re so focused on being perfect, we tend to view mistakes as -- at worse -- fireable offenses. If thatâ€™s the assumption you make with every typo, missed deadline, or other mistake, your confidence is going to take a huge hit.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Instead, when a â€œcrisisâ€ occurs, try your best to step back and put it into perspective. How bad is it, really? Are you completely powerless to it, or is there something you can do to address it now? Once youâ€™ve fully evaluated the problem -- which should only require about five minutes of deep breath and de-escalation from your panic -- gaining the confidence to tackle the issue might be easier than it first looked.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;3) Donâ€™t turn failure into a self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As we covered above, many of us allow our perfectionism to manifest as an overreaction to mistakes. If thatâ€™s how we constantly behave in the face of performance that doesnâ€™t meet our own standards, could we start habitually expecting failure from ourselves?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yes. Thatâ€™s because &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/11/impostor-syndrome-at-work-can-be-a-self-fulfilling-prophecy.html"&gt;70% of us suffer from something called Imposter Syndrome&lt;/a&gt; -- the sense that, no matter how much weâ€™ve achieved, we donâ€™t belong in a leadership position or deserve the success of having gotten there. And according to recent &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5037221/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, going through life feeling like an imposter can cause us to bring less confidence (and therefore, less quality) to our work, turning it into a self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s easy to discount our success as undeserving, and to easily dismiss our hard work. But if we keep sending those messages to ourselves, weâ€™ll start to accept them as truth and itâ€™ll reflect in our work.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, the opposite is also true -- which psychologist Amy Cuddy touched on in her wildly popular &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are"&gt;TEDGlobal talk&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, sheâ€™s continued her research on the power of â€œ&lt;a href="http://blog.ted.com/fake-it-til-you-become-it-amy-cuddys-power-poses-visualized/"&gt;faking it until you become it&lt;/a&gt;.â€ Thatâ€™s when we send ourselves the &lt;i&gt;opposite&lt;/i&gt; message of failure, instead reaffirming our power, success, and worth. That approach to work can achieve a reverse self-fulfilling process, in which we learn to believe in our success, instead of feeling like weâ€™re imposters.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Check out this helpful visual guide that explains how body language can help beat Imposter Syndrome. Even by assuming a certain stance, we can instill confidence in ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-youtube"&gt;
        &lt;iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ks-_Mh1QhMc" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;4) Evaluate how engaged you are at work.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thereâ€™s a problem in the U.S. workplace. Many people donâ€™t really want to be there, as evidenced by the fact that only &lt;a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/180404/gallup-daily-employee-engagement.aspx"&gt;34.2% of people are actually engaged at work&lt;/a&gt;. In short, that means we just donâ€™t care. And when we donâ€™t care, our work suffers -- how can we bring quality to something for which we have so little passion?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you feel that disengaged at work, you have a few options. First, you can speak with your manager -- again. Chances are, he or she has noticed your work is suffering, and if youâ€™re able to honestly explain why, that might lead to &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/unstuck-career#sm.00001jv8k2j9vzembr7434ir2v3u3"&gt;a productive conversation about the direction of your career.&lt;/a&gt; From there, it all depends on how that discussion ends. If your manager isnâ€™t receptive, then it might be time to consider a &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/career-change-advice"&gt;career change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;5) Formulate a plan for how youâ€™ll avoid another bad month.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, there are months in which you really did screw up. Itâ€™s okay -- weâ€™ve all been there, which weâ€™ll get to later.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The important thing is that you recognize what went wrong, and that you know how youâ€™re going to prevent it from happening again. When I worked in event planning, we did that for every engagement. We kicked off every project by outlining every possible problem that could arise, but unexpected issues still came up. When they did, we documented all of them and, after the event, formulated a plan to avoid them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That strategy isnâ€™t limited to events, and most workplace mistakes can be treated the same way. As soon as theyâ€™ve been resolved, record them and consider sharing them with your team -- thatâ€™s the best way to ensure that they donâ€™t happen again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;6) Know that failure is not uncommon.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;'Tis a lesson you should heed:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;Try, try again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;If at first you donâ€™t succeed,&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;Try, try again.â€&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;William Edward Hickson&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not too long ago, two researchers in Texas performed &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-28/study-failed-entrepreneurs-find-success-the-second-time-around"&gt;a study on the failure rate of new businesses&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1990 and 2011, they found that 92% of the 2.4 million retail businesses that opened during that period also closed during the same span of time. Among the businesses that closed, 25% did so after one year, and 50% closed after two. Roughly 75% of them were owned by first-time entrepreneurs, and 71% percent of the failed business owners didnâ€™t bother trying again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That last figure is a shame, since the same study also found that the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-28/study-failed-entrepreneurs-find-success-the-second-time-around"&gt;29% of business owners who decided to try again were more likely to be successful on subsequent tries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Two things about this study stand out to us:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The commonality and high rate of failure.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The success rate of people who try again.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To the first point, donâ€™t feel isolated in your failure. And as long as youâ€™re acknowledging that making mistakes -- and maybe even failing -- happen to almost everyone, donâ€™t give up, either. As the numbers show, you likely have more to lose by not trying again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;7) Evaluate what you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; control.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When things are going so well, itâ€™s easy for us to stop taking care of ourselves. That could be why &lt;a href="http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2015/impact-of-discrimination.pdf"&gt;39% of adults indulge in unhealthy food when theyâ€™re stressed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While an occasional treat is fine, treating chronic stress with poor nutrition or a lack of exercise will only make matters worse. And hereâ€™s the thing -- those are parts of your life that you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; control. Itâ€™s easy to feel like stressful work situations spiral beyond a solution that you can reach on your own. But self-care? Youâ€™ve got this.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Much of the time, constant &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/business-travel-health-tips"&gt;business travel&lt;/a&gt; is blamed for an unhealthy lifestyle, but weâ€™ve got some tips to keep that in check, too -- many of which can also be applied to a busy life at home. Plus, what you eat plays a vital role in your productivity. Check out my colleague Lindsay Kolowichâ€™s &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/productivity-diet#sm.0000e1w1nuwvbeo5sq61j1tim2kyj"&gt;guidelines for eating to get more done&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;8) Take a break.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hereâ€™s a thought. Could you be making more mistakes than usual because youâ€™re burned out?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In Germany, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/190049/high-cost-worker-burnout-germany.aspx?g_source=burnout&amp;amp;g_medium=search&amp;amp;g_campaign=tiles"&gt;24% of employees report feeling burned out&lt;/a&gt;. When weâ€™re feeling such a high level of stress from overworking, it achieves the opposite of getting more done -- it actually starts to negatively impact our cognitive function. We start to get forgetful, make mindless errors, and might even have &lt;a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/burnout-and-the-brain"&gt;stronger emotional responses to negative situations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In other words, you need a break. Guilt can get in the way of that -- after all, &lt;a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/infographs/breakroom-2014-infographic.html"&gt;55% of us feel bad about leaving our desks just for a breather&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/guilt-sabotage-work#sm.0000e1w1nuwvbeo5sq61j1tim2kyj"&gt;47% of us are ashamed of taking time off&lt;/a&gt;. But the longer we let that trend continue, the closer we get to complete burnout, and the more likely our work is to suffer as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Seriously -- take a break. And maybe even put that vacation time to use. When you come back, youâ€™ll have a renewed perspective that can help you tackle your goals.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Starting to Rebuild&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Feel better?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We certainly hope so. As you begin to regain your confidence after a bad month -- or making the effort to do so -- take your time. Evaluate your priorities, and see which of these tips best fits in with them. Don't try to tackle them all at once, or else you might end up feeling overwhelmed, which would defeat the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here's to the new year ahead. Best of luck -- we know you've got this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Forget Networking: Become a Connector</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/forget-networking-become-a-connector</link>
      <description>
        &lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/forget-networking-become-a-connector" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/ThinkstockPhotos-532049662-483225-edited.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="ThinkstockPhotos-532049662-483225-edited.jpg" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No matter how far you advance your career, networking is likely never going to be something you enjoy. And for the introverted among us, it can feel like weâ€™re being forced back into those endless icebreaker exercises we had to do at corporate retreats while we were coming up. So, letâ€™s stop.&lt;/p&gt;
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ThinkstockPhotos-532049662-483225-edited.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;height=302&amp;amp;name=ThinkstockPhotos-532049662-483225-edited.jpg" alt="ThinkstockPhotos-532049662-483225-edited.jpg" width="730" height="302"&gt;No matter how far you advance your career, networking is likely never going to be something you enjoy. And for the introverted among us, it can feel like weâ€™re being forced back into those endless icebreaker exercises we had to do at corporate retreats while we were coming up. So, letâ€™s stop.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Wait, what?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You read that correctly. Letâ€™s stop networking. Instead, &lt;a href="https://learn.penguinstrategies.com/linkedin-groups-webinar-on-demand"&gt;letâ€™s start connecting&lt;/a&gt; and helping.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you start looking at networking as a way to help people, it gets a lot easier. Remember what Jim Rohn once said: â€œIf you help enough people get what they want, inevitably you get what you want.â€ Hereâ€™s how you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Be Approachable&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Networking and industry meet-and-greets are inherently uncomfortable, even for the extroverted out there. Thankfully, as someone who has already worked her way up the ladder, you are now the connection people hope to gain. This means that, while you are getting your bearings, you can let people come to you. This is far easier than trying to force yourself to start conversations before youâ€™re ready to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;The Buddy System&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Youâ€™re never too old or too high up the food chain to eschew the buddy system. In this instance, what youâ€™re going to do is pair up with someone extroverted. The extroverts among us are fantastic at taking the leap to make introductions and striking up conversations in uncomfortable environments. As someone more introverted, your strength is keeping the conversation going by asking questions and paying close attention to how the person responds. Itâ€™s a symbiotic relationship and can help your extroverted â€œbuddyâ€ as much as it helps you.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Step it Up a Notch&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By now you know that networking is about more than the initial meeting. It is about following up on that meeting. The simplest way to do this is to follow each other on social media. The casual nature of &lt;a href="https://www.penguinstrategies.com/blog/7-tactics-maximize-benefits-of-social-media"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; allows you to keep up with each other without a ton of effort. The connection can grow at its own pace. Reply to their posts. Promote their posts. Inevitably youâ€™ll see one of your connections need something. This is when you make your move. Suggest a solution, offer to help, offer to connect that person with someone you know who can help them, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Build Credibility&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This works so well because youâ€™ve already built up trust with your connection. You feel like you know each other already, so helping them &lt;a href="https://learn.penguinstrategies.com/how-penguin-strategies-helped-edgewater-networks-implement-a-successful-inbound-marketing-strategy"&gt;solve a problem&lt;/a&gt; wonâ€™t feel strange or awkward. And it increases the likelihood that your offer will be seen and, more importantly, taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now what you must do is follow through on your offers. The hard part is not promising more than you know you can deliver. One of the best parts of making progress in your career is having the means to lend a hand to those who are still working their way up. Mentoring and helping others advance can become almost an addiction. Therefore, you need to be objective. Apply your business know-how to your urge to help and remember: it is better to promise small and deliver big than to promise big and deliver small.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Grow, Baby, Grow&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The nice thing about this approach is that it takes the awkwardness of networking and turns it into an introvert-friendly and organic connection process. Best of all, your initial success will build upon itself naturally over time. It will be the best automated process youâ€™ve ever developed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;People who actually enjoy networking are the unicorns of the business world. Most of the people you meet will be just like you: forcing themselves to do something incredibly awkward that they hate because they know it will help grow their companies. Your urge to avoid it is understandable. Still, try using the method weâ€™ve outlined here. Itâ€™s awkwardness reduction properties will make networking much easier to endure.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/433607/d3b2408a-5b46-450d-86df-6fc384cb7ffc"&gt;&lt;img src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/433607/d3b2408a-5b46-450d-86df-6fc384cb7ffc.png" alt="New Call-to-action"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;   &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;img src="http://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;amp;k=14&amp;amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fforget-networking-become-a-connector&amp;amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;amp;bvt=rss" alt="" width="1" height="1" style="min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; "&gt;

      <title>The Science Behind the Most Popular Infographics of 2016</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/science-behind-popular-infographics</link>
      <description>
        &lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/science-behind-popular-infographics" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/ThinkstockPhotos-519749523-compressor%20(1).jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="ThinkstockPhotos-519749523-compressor (1).jpg" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What makes people want to share an infographic?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Is it a certain color scheme that catches the eye? Do certain formats work better than others? Or, in the end, is it all about the content? At &lt;a href="http://www.visme.co/"&gt;Visme&lt;/a&gt;, we set out to answer these questions by performing a content analysis of the most shared infographics on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ThinkstockPhotos-519749523-compressor%20(1).jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=761&amp;amp;name=ThinkstockPhotos-519749523-compressor%20(1).jpg" alt="Science of Infographics" width="761" title="Science of Infographics" style="width: 761px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What makes people want to share an infographic?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Is it a certain color scheme that catches the eye? Do certain formats work better than others? Or, in the end, is it all about the content? At &lt;a href="http://www.visme.co/"&gt;Visme&lt;/a&gt;, we set out to answer these questions by performing a content analysis of the most shared infographics on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href="http://buzzsumo.com/"&gt;BuzzSumo&lt;/a&gt;, we identified every infographic with more than 5,000 shares across some major social media platforms -- Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google+ -- and analyzed them for different characteristics. Those were things like word count, size, colors used, format, and topic. &lt;a class="cta_button" href="https://offers.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=dc2acf6a-f8c1-44a8-ac28-b628a791cd9d&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid="&gt; &lt;img class="hs-cta-img " style="border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; " alt="Save countless hours using these free, pre-made templates to design your  infographics." src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/dc2acf6a-f8c1-44a8-ac28-b628a791cd9d.png"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here's what we found after analyzing over 200 infographics -- and takeaways on how you can apply these insights to your own infographics, making them more shareable.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;10 Factors Behind the Most Popular Infographics of 2016&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1) Most Popular Industries&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Most-Popular-Infographics-By-Industry.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Most-Popular-Infographics-By-Industry.jpg" alt="Most-Popular-Infographics-By-Industry.jpg" width="669" title="Most-Popular-Infographics-By-Industry.jpg" style="width: 669px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Infographics were once used to simplify complex topics with the sole purpose of educating the viewer. Now, they're seen as a highly shareable content format, with the same viral potential as memes -- after all, &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;visual content is 40X more likely to get shared on social media&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That could explain why we found that most of the past year's top-shared infographics were in categories like entertainment, sports, health, psychology, lifestyle, and food. And from the evolution of Justin Bieberâ€™s music, to a visual of Kobe Bryantâ€™s career highlights, the most shared infographics of 2016 also had celebrities as their central focus.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Many of the most popular infographics were also focused on topics personally relevant to readersâ€™ lives, like health and lifestyle tips -- which contrasts from content on politics, global causes, or news.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Takeaways for Marketers&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Focus on creating infographics that directly appeal to readersâ€™ personal needs and goals. Creating a &lt;a href="http://www.makemypersona.com/"&gt;buyer persona&lt;/a&gt; can help, as it helps you to understand what those goals are.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;2) Most Popular Industries by Social Network&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Most-Popular-Industries-By-Social-Network.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Most-Popular-Industries-By-Social-Network.jpg" alt="Most-Popular-Industries-By-Social-Network.jpg" width="669" title="Most-Popular-Industries-By-Social-Network.jpg" style="width: 669px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Certain topics perform better on different social networks. As the site with the &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/"&gt;most users&lt;/a&gt;, for example, Facebook seems to be the place to post content related to entertainment, sports, health, psychology, and education. Meanwhile, infographics with career-related content do best on LinkedIn, where youâ€™re also most likely to find infographics on finance and business topics.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On Pinterest, content related to health, psychology, food and lifestyle perform best. Roughly &lt;a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/08/19/the-demographics-of-social-media-users/"&gt;31% of online adults use this social network -- compared to 72% for Facebook -- with the majority of users being women&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Twitter, conversely, appears to be the place to post content related to jobs, entertainment, sports, and education. With &lt;a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/08/19/the-demographics-of-social-media-users/"&gt;23% of online adults using it&lt;/a&gt;, it's comparatively lagging among other social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Takeaways for Marketers&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you're developing your buyer personas, figure out where they "live" online. Combined with their interests and goals, that will help you determine where they're most likely to discover your visual content.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;3) Most Popular Infographics by Type&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Most-Popular-Infographics-By-Type.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Most-Popular-Infographics-By-Type.jpg" alt="Most-Popular-Infographics-By-Type.jpg" width="669" title="Most-Popular-Infographics-By-Type.jpg" style="width: 669px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not all infographics are created equal. From timelines, to maps, to charts, to the occasional article that's converted into an infographic -- No one of these visuals is identical to another.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And while some might argue that the last format -- the article-as-an-infographic -- isn't &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; an infographic since it contains no numbers, we found it to be the most popular one. They don't actually include any statistics, charts, or visualizations. Rather, they contain existing informational content enhanced by colors, icons, and other illustrations.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The second-most popular type in this sample was the how-to infographic, which guides readers through steps to achieve a certain outcome. Within this category are â€œcheat sheetsâ€ -- the infographics that compile all the information readers need to complete a particular task, within a single graphic. Think: keyboard shortcuts for Mac, or baking and cooking substitutions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For the sake of comparison, here are some additional formats that were included in our sample:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Mixed charts:&amp;nbsp;Uses a variety of charts and graphs&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Single charts: Displays one chart or graph&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Visualized numbers: Uses icons, colors, and other graphical elements to visualize stats and figures&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Anatomical: Visualizes the parts of a whole&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Timeline: Visualizes a chronological sequence of events&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Location: Visualizes a geographical location through a map&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Comparison: Compares more than one thing or idea, side-by-side&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Process: Uses a flowchart or decision tree&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Takeaways for Marketers&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For the most part -- and to our surprise -- infographics with the least amount of statistics and numbers performed best on social media. The one exception to that rule is a visual cheat sheet, which serves as a quick and handy guide. So when you include data in your infographics, choose wisely and keep it limited.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;4) Most Popular Types of Infographics by Social Network&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Most-Popular-Types-of-Infographics-by-Social-Network.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Most-Popular-Types-of-Infographics-by-Social-Network.jpg" alt="Most-Popular-Types-of-Infographics-by-Social-Network.jpg" width="669" title="Most-Popular-Types-of-Infographics-by-Social-Network.jpg" style="width: 669px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To further analyze the performance of different infographic formats, we also examined how each type of infographic performed best on different social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We found that informational and single charts, for example, performed best across Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Single charts were particularly popular on Twitter, as the nature of the platform favors &lt;a href="http://linchpinseo.com/the-rise-of-micro-content"&gt;micro-content&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cheat sheets and how-to infographics, meanwhile, worked best on Pinterest, which aligned with the topics we found to be most popular on that particular network -- the greatest number of visuals were related to food, cooking, lifestyle, and hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Takeaways for Marketers&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you create your visual content strategy, plan for a diverse portfolio of infographic formats. That way, you'll have a broad selection of content that you can share across different social networks, depending on where it's shown to perform best.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;5) Median Word Count per Number of Shares&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Median-Word-Count-Per-Number-of-Shares.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Median-Word-Count-Per-Number-of-Shares.jpg" alt="Median-Word-Count-Per-Number-of-Shares.jpg" width="669" title="Median-Word-Count-Per-Number-of-Shares.jpg" style="width: 669px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A main purpose of infographics is to present complex information in a visual, easy-to-digest way. As expected, the most popular infographics also had some of the shortest word counts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In order to account for one outlier in the sample -- an infographic with a whopping 10,500 words -- we calculated the median word count for each of five quintiles within the distribution of this sample, according to shares. Those were ranked from lowest to highest.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From there, we saw that the trend roughly followed this pattern: The more words an infographic contained, the less it was shared.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Takeaways for Marketers&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Simply put, keep your infographics short and sweet. In general, they should contain no more than a pageâ€™s worth of written content, and even that's a bit on the long side.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;6) Median Word Count per Network&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Median-Word-Count-Per-Network.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Median-Word-Count-Per-Network.jpg" alt="Median-Word-Count-Per-Network.jpg" width="669" title="Median-Word-Count-Per-Network.jpg" style="width: 669px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We were also curious to find out if longer infographics performed better on certain social networks. After calculating the median word count of the top 50 most-shared infographics on each network, we found that the shortest infographics performed best on Facebook and Twitter. Conversely, the longest were shared most on Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Google+.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Takeaways for Marketers&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here's where your diverse portfolio of visual content again enters the picture. Aim for Facebook and Twitter with infographics that are mostly comprised of visuals and minimal text. With longer, more in-depth infographics, go for LinkedIn and Pinterest.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;7) Colors Used in Popular Infographics&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Colors-Used-in-Popular-Infographics.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Colors-Used-in-Popular-Infographics.jpg" alt="Colors-Used-in-Popular-Infographics.jpg" width="669" title="Colors-Used-in-Popular-Infographics.jpg" style="width: 669px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Color palettes play a huge role in the way an infographic is perceived by viewers. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;Visuals with color increase a person's willingness to read a piece of content by 80%&lt;/a&gt;, but it has to be used correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We found that blue is, by far, the most widely-used color among popular infographics, followed by red and green. Secondary and composite colors that appeared in the sample included brown, yellow, orange, purple, and pink.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But despite the popularity of monochromatic color schemes, there were relatively few infographics that applied variations of a single hue. Instead, most applied between three and four different colors, including such neutral colors as white, black, and grey.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Takeaways for Marketers&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Be mindful of your palette when you're creating content. Regardless of social network, it seems, primary colors like blue, red, and green are safe bets -- and perform well across a variety of topics and industries.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;8) Median Size of Popular Infographics&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Median-Size-of-Popular-infographics.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Median-Size-of-Popular-infographics.jpg" alt="Median-Size-of-Popular-infographics.jpg" width="669" title="Median-Size-of-Popular-infographics.jpg" style="width: 669px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here's another category where we had a bit of an outlier -- one extremely long infographic that weighed in at 1,024 by 46,515 pixels. To keep it from skewing our results, we calculated the median size of the best performing infographics on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We found that the median of this sample was 800 by 2619 pixels. That roughly translates to an infographic with a length that's slightly more than three times its width.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Takeaways for Marketers&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When it comes to infographics, keep things vertical. That said, keep a healthy perspective on the dimensions -- The best-performing infographics are three-to-four times longer than they are wide.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;9) Average Number of Shares by Alexa Rating&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Average-Number-of-Shares-By-Alexa-Rating.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Average-Number-of-Shares-By-Alexa-Rating.jpg" alt="Average-Number-of-Shares-By-Alexa-Rating.jpg" width="669" title="Average-Number-of-Shares-By-Alexa-Rating.jpg" style="width: 669px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Curious as to how site rankings compare to the number of shares received, we also sorted the sample according to ratings from Alexa -- a site that measures traffic -- for the sites on which they were originally published.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We started with the sites that had highest rankings -- and, therefore, the greatest amount of traffic -- and ordered them in descending order to those with the lowest rankings. We then divided the population into five quintiles, as we did in measuring the median word count per number of shares.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The results were a bit counterintuitive. We found that the sites at both the top 20% and bottom 20% of the Alexa rating distribution actually had the least amount of shares. Those that fell in the middle, however, received the greatest amount of shares.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While more data would be required to fully explain those results, it could have something to do with the fact that many mainstream media outlets -- which are at the higher end of the traffic spectrum -- tend not to publish infographics that are particularly shareable, according to the factors we considered in this study. Instead, they tend to publish visuals like single charts that are mostly educational in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Takeaways for Marketers&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Evaluate your priorities. Do you care more about shareability, or traffic? Infographics appearing on sites with low Alexa ratings still managed to garner over 20,000 shares. We're big advocates for focusing on creating good content -- if it's shareable, it will attract views. From there, you don't have as much control over &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; it's shared, regardless of traffic, but no one can accuse you of creating sub-par content.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;10) Average Number of Shares by Social Network&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Average-Number-od-Shares-By-Social-Network.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Average-Number-od-Shares-By-Social-Network.jpg" alt="Average-Number-of-Shares-By-Social-Network.jpg" width="669" title="Average-Number-of-Shares-By-Social-Network.jpg" style="width: 669px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Last, but certainly not least, we found that Facebook and Pinterest were overall the best places to share infographics. The remaining social media platforms exhibited significantly smaller averages of total shares.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Takeaways for Marketers&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If virality is your primary goal, look to Facebook and Pinterest first. After you see success there, you can experiment with posting your infographic on LinkedIn and Twitter, and evaluate how it performs there.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Make It Visual&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When it comes to the importance of visuals in marketing, the numbers speak for themselves -- &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;71% of online marketers use them in their social media strategies&lt;/a&gt;. But with so much visual content out there, especially infographics, it's important to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As you begin to plan your content for the coming year, keep these tips in mind. Carving out a name for yourself in the world of viral infographics is a good thing -- but maintain the momentum with a diverse portfolio of images.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What factors have made your infographics shareable? Let us know in the comments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a class="cta_button" href="https://offers.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=533acc01-d1a9-4b4c-a5b3-d746ecdf1855&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid="&gt; &lt;img class="hs-cta-img " style="border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; " alt="15 free infographic templates in powerpoint" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/533acc01-d1a9-4b4c-a5b3-d746ecdf1855.png"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Looking for a marketing strategy that'll give you that extra leg up in 2017?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While itâ€™s always helpful and entertaining to spend hours absorbed in the blog posts, webinars, and podcasts from your favorite marketing influencers, thereâ€™s not always time for that. And with January 1 just a few short days away, you need to finalize your plans -- fast.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog_Thinkstock_Images/Marketing-Insights-for-2017-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;name=Marketing-Insights-for-2017-compressor.jpg" alt="Marketing-Insights-for-2017" width="730" title="Marketing-Insights-for-2017" style="width: 730px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Looking for a marketing strategy that'll give you that extra leg up in 2017?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While itâ€™s always helpful and entertaining to spend hours absorbed in the blog posts, webinars, and podcasts from your favorite marketing influencers, thereâ€™s not always time for that. And with January 1 just a few short days away, you need to finalize your plans -- fast.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So in addition to all that content, &lt;strong&gt;why not&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;look at what your favorite influencers are actually doing &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;themselves&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When I went to &lt;a href="http://www.inbound.com/"&gt;HubSpot's &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.inbound.com/"&gt;INBOUND event&lt;/a&gt; last month, that was my goal. Before I even got to Boston, my coworkers and I started planning who we wanted to learn from. We made a list, we checked it twice, and we set out to learn from the best.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Guess what?&lt;em&gt; It paid off.&lt;/em&gt; While there, we spoke to some of the smartest people in inbound marketing and found out what marketing strategies theyâ€™re excited to use more in 2017. Thatâ€™s not to mention what we learned in their talks and sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Check out the infographic below for some of the most helpful highlights from folks like Gary Vaynerchuk, Peg Fitzpatrick, Larry Kim, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scope Creep Is Killing Your Bottom Line: Here's How to Prevent It</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/scope-creep-bottom-line</link>
      <description>
        &lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/scope-creep-bottom-line" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/00-Blog_Thinkstock_Images/scope-creep-bottom-line.png?t=1483790613555" alt="Scope Creep Is Killing Your Bottom Line: Here's How to Prevent It" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Picture this all-too-common scenario: You're 12 revisions into a client project, when you promised only four. You've now spent almost triple the time you intended on the project, which gives you less time (and energy) to devote to other clients.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It's a frustrating situation, for sure, but the damage goes beyond that -- it's also hurting your bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/00-Blog_Thinkstock_Images/scope-creep-bottom-line.png?t=1483790613555"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Picture this all-too-common scenario: You're 12 revisions into a client project, when you promised only four. You've now spent almost triple the time you intended on the project, which gives you less time (and energy) to devote to other clients.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It's a frustrating situation, for sure, but the damage goes beyond that -- it's also hurting your bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Scope creep is the ever-lurking monster under the bed for marketing agencies. A recent &lt;a href="http://more.deltek.com/State-of-Workflow-Management-SoDA-Report"&gt;Deltek study on agency workflows&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, found that &lt;strong&gt;nearly 40 percent of agencies exceed their budgets because of scope creep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It whittles away at your profitability, and when you're constantly handing out a dozen or more revisions, it also sets unrealistic expectations for your clients. If left unchecked, it can mean less time for your agency to grow its business.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Of course, there's a fine line between providing good service to your clients -- which sometimes does require going above and beyond -- and flat-out giving away your services for free.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I'm not suggesting you nickel-and-dime clients to death, but it is essential to set strict limitations on what you will (and won't) do and stick to them. Otherwise, your profits will continue to seep out of the hole you've failed to block up at the bottom of your boat.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Scope Creep Starts with Vague Proposal Documents&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It's easy to blame clients for scope creep, but truthfully the blame sits right at your feet. At the end of the day, it's your responsibility to serve as the gatekeeper of your agency's services. Scope creep is entirely yours -- not your client's -- to control.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vague proposal documents are the number one culprit when it comes to this problem.&lt;/strong&gt; They lead to over-servicing your clients, which in turn leads to lower profits.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The key: Set limits, set boundaries, and be very specific. Good scope documents include assumptions about both the project and the processes. Clearly outline the ripple effect that will happen if one piece of the project is delayed or altered, and detail how changes should be addressed, should the need arise.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Your clients need to know explicitly what they can and cannot expect from your team. If you specifically outline the deliverables you will provide each quarter, with little room for interpretation, then you'll be setting yourself up for success.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;It's a Numbers Game: Know the Math, Increase Profits&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;OK, so you know you need to tighten up your language on your proposal documents, but where do you start?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before you add in any additional fees for excessive revisions or change orders, you must intimately know the math and exactly how your agency makes money.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You may find that you are literally paying for the privilege of working with certain clients. If you run profitability reports for your clients (and you should), you might see that certain clients -- those who consistently exceed scope with "small projects" and "just one more revision" -- are actually costing you money.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But it's not just agency leaders who need to be financially savvy. Your account team also should have a clear understanding of how the business works. After all, they are the ones in charge of communicating with the client and monitoring the budget.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If they donâ€™t understand agency math -- or how you spend your AGI -- then how are they supposed to know when to say "yes" or "no" to a client request?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;3 Strategies for Stopping Scope Creep in Its Tracks&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Scope creep is an issue all agencies face, but it's not impossible to stamp out of your business practices. Here are three strategies to ensure you're both maximizing profitability and providing clients with top-shelf service.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1) Teach Your Employees the Rules of the Game&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Every single day, your agency is either making money or losing money.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If your team members don't understand the dollars-and-cents of the business, they will continue to believe their greatest priority is keeping clients happy. The easiest way to do this, of course, is to over-service clients -- not a great tactic for maximizing profits.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;if you educate all employees on the costs of your goods and services, they'll be better able to balance keeping clients happy and servicing your firm.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;2) Leave No Room for Misinterpretation in Your Scope Documents&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;At the very least, your scope documents should define your deliverables, the number of revisions you're willing to do, and each project's timetable.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Use language that leaves no room for interpretation, such as "With this estimate, you are going to be granted four revisions. Any revision after the fourth will result in a $250 fee."&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The number of revisions and the fee amount should be tailored to your agency, but the important thing is that your client knows from the very beginning of your contracted relationship exactly what they're agreeing to. Once the client signs the document, there doesn't have to be a big discussion every time the fifth revision rolls around.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;3) Don't Be Afraid to Issue Change Orders&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Change orders give your scope documents some teeth. How you treat changes in scope helps train your clients with how much you're willing to bend. So try not to bend.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The biggest reason change orders aren't issued is that agency leaders and employees think they don't have enough time or itâ€™s not worth the headache. Here's how the thinking usually goes: "By the time I calculate the change order cost, write up a document, and get it signed by the client, I could have just made the change."&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The reality, though, is that you can't afford to not issue change orders. By doing this, you'll prevent the client from future abuse of scope. You want to make the client happy, but you are also running a business. And businesses run on profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There will be times when the client or the circumstance justifies waiving that change order fee. But by having the fees in place, those free revisions become a gift you are giving clients, not a right. Giving one revision out gratis sure beats handing out 10 for free -- which is what you may be doing now.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being specific and firm with your scope won't damage your client relationships.&lt;/strong&gt; Rather, being firm will train them to get their ducks in a row before they request changes or revisions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It's tough love, sure, but you'll be surprised how receptive your clients will be to having firm parameters to operate within. Most importantly, you'll no longer have to watch project scope continually creep and profitability shrink.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Your Company Might Need a Content Audit</title>

        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/company-content-audit" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/ThinkstockPhotos-506147556-568616-edited.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="ThinkstockPhotos-506147556-568616-edited.jpg" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Content is used as a valuable marketing tool across all industries. From social media content to long-form evergreen content, marketers constantly write to build awareness and nurture &amp;nbsp;relationships. While the goal of content marketing is clear, many companies forget to track what type of content is actually working.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ThinkstockPhotos-506147556-568616-edited.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;height=302&amp;amp;name=ThinkstockPhotos-506147556-568616-edited.jpg" alt="ThinkstockPhotos-506147556-568616-edited.jpg" width="730" height="302"&gt;Content is used as a valuable marketing tool across all industries. From social media content to long-form evergreen content, marketers constantly write to build awareness and nurture &amp;nbsp;relationships. While the goal of content marketing is clear, many companies forget to track what type of content is actually working.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Even powerhouse &lt;a href="http://www.gerrymcgovern.com/new-thinking/removing-poor-quality-content-increases-customer-satisfaction"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; fell into that habit. At one point the Microsoft.com website had 10 million pages of content but 3 million of them had never been visited. By removing unnecessary and irrelevant content, Microsoft made its customers much happier and learned what type of content works in attracting consumers. And all of that happened by conducting a content audit.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/465783/hubfs/ironpaper/notecard-image-3.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=391&amp;amp;name=notecard-image-3.jpg" alt="notecard-image-3.jpg" width="391" style="width: 391px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;5 Reasons for a Content Audit&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are a variety of reasons that a company might need a content audit. Here are some of the problems that plague companies because of the lack of a content audit.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 1em;"&gt;Lots of Traffic Coming in But Not Many Qualified Leads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hereâ€™s a scary stat: &lt;a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Lead-Generation-Poses-Biggest-Challenge-B2Bs/1009829"&gt;one-third of B2B marketers&lt;/a&gt; donâ€™t track where their leads come from. This clearly needs to be corrected in order to figure out what marketing channels work and which should be eliminated. Once your company takes a look at lead generation, you may find that while more and more traffic comes in, none if it is really relevant to your brand.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is oftentimes a content problem. The content could be attracting the wrong target and therefore no one converts. &lt;a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/53/file-1444898250-pdf/Driving_Content_Marketing_Success_-_Europe_2014-2.pdf?__hstc=20629287.b50af227aa7163d3f1412d9ab92a3457.1465439880365.1481202508923.1481205618902.393&amp;amp;__hssc=20629287.4.1481205618902&amp;amp;__hsfp=3631117429&amp;amp;t=1483790613555"&gt;56% of survey respondents&lt;/a&gt; said they were doing content marketing without a plan. When qualified leads are not coming in, maybe the content was not written with a clear buyer persona; therefore, the content does not address a specific need or pain point of that audience.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 1em;"&gt;Unclear Value Proposition = Unclear Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Only &lt;a href="http://advisor.newportboardgroup.com/why-a-value-proposition-is-important"&gt;7% of leadership teams&lt;/a&gt; can explain a clear, common value proposition, but 85% of CEOs say their employees can state the companyâ€™s value proposition. This dichotomy leads to very unclear content. If writers do not have a clear picture of the companyâ€™s value, then the content will reflect this and appear confusing to the reader. A value proposition helps build relevance for target buyer personas, helping to improve engagement, shares, conversions, and trust. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 1em;"&gt;Blog Doesnâ€™t Play a Role in Sales&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;B2B marketers that use blogs receive &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/danny-wong/the-why-12-distinct-goals_b_5651566.html?utm_hp_ref=business&amp;amp;ir=Business"&gt;67% more leads&lt;/a&gt; than those who do not. Many companies, however, do not use the blog as part of the sales process, which means no leads or opportunities come through because of the blog.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This can be because the &lt;a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2016/12/content-marketing-sales-together/"&gt;sales and content marketing teams are not aligned&lt;/a&gt;. The blog should help push leads down the sales funnel, helping to produce qualified leads. A companyâ€™s blog can also help provide sales teams useful nurturing content as they help prospects navigate the awareness, consideration, and decision stages of the buying process.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 1em;"&gt;Leads or Sales Goals Arenâ€™t Met&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If leads or sales metrics are falling behind, surprisingly this could be because the content strategy is not tied to the sales strategy. Before revising the sales process, performing a content audit could uncover why certain goals arenâ€™t met. &lt;a href="http://www.ironpaper.com/webintel/articles/benefits-of-integrating-of-sales-and-marketing/"&gt;Content must aid the sales process&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href="http://www.curata.com/resources/ebooks/business-blogging-secrets-revealed"&gt;41% of businesses&lt;/a&gt; say curated content increased the number and/or quality of sales-ready leads.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 1em;"&gt;Blog Subscribers Donâ€™t Read Your Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If people that actively subscribed to your blog content are not reading it, then a content audit is desperately needed. By finding out why these people subscribed, you can start to get your content back on track. Perhaps with different team members writing, blog content began to drift from its original purpose, making it no longer useful for the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;What To Do Next&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before launching into a full scale content audit, take a step back and ask some key questions about the content being created.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/465783/hubfs/ironpaper/notecard-image-1.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=392&amp;amp;name=notecard-image-1.jpg" alt="notecard-image-1.jpg" width="392" style="width: 392px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the Content Value-Driven?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Does the content align with the companyâ€™s value proposition? What are the key value points that relate to your customer and does the content reflect this?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the Content Persona-Driven?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Does your content align to the needs, interests, and opportunities associated with target buyer personas or an ideal buyer profile?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the Content Results-Driven?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Does your content assist in the conversion of leads and sales opportunities? Does the marketing team align efforts with results? Which content assists in conversions of leads and which content does not? Using Hubspot, identify which content directly influencers sales qualified leads.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have You Invested in a Content Strategy?&lt;/strong&gt; Have time and resources been fully invested to craft the best content strategy? Has this content team continually updated and improve and build upon top-performing content?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are the Sales and Marketing Teams Aligned?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.ironpaper.com/webintel/articles/defining-the-b2b-marketing-to-sales-lifecycle/"&gt;Content can play a huge role in sales&lt;/a&gt;, so identify the weak points in the sales process and align marketing strategies along those points. Have you found opportunities to support, educate, inspire, and guide buyers through the sales funnel? Content can help with each step, so marketing and sales teams should meet on a consistent basis.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/465783/hubfs/ironpaper/notecard-image-2.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=391&amp;amp;name=notecard-image-2.jpg" alt="notecard-image-2.jpg" width="391" style="width: 391px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;You Probably Need a Content Audit&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you answered no to any of these questions, then it is time for a content audit. A content audit can help improve sales, make your customers happier, and get rid of unnecessary pages that can be bogging down your website, so if you have fallen into any of the traps listed above, itâ€™s time to audit the content on your website.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why You Should Start With Copy Instead of Design: A Data-Backed Lesson</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/copy-design-data-lesson</link>
      <description>
        &lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/copy-design-data-lesson" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/00-Blog_Thinkstock_Images/copywriting-2.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="Why You Should Start With Copy Instead of Design: A Data-Backed Lesson" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Most conversion rate optimization experts you'll meet would agree: &lt;strong&gt;Copywriting first. Design second.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The idea is that copy (and the message&amp;nbsp;you're trying to convey&amp;nbsp;through that copy) should dictate design&amp;nbsp;â€“ not the other way around. Now, this is in no way meant to underestimate the importance of design. Design can breathe life into the story the copy is telling, and done properly, great copy plus great design will always outperform great copy alone.&lt;/p&gt;
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/copywriting-before-design.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;name=copywriting-before-design.jpg" alt="copywriting-before-design.jpg" width="730" title="copywriting-before-design.jpg" style="width: 730px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Most conversion rate optimization experts you'll meet would agree: &lt;strong&gt;Copywriting first. Design second.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The idea is that copy (and the message&amp;nbsp;you're trying to convey&amp;nbsp;through that copy) should dictate design&amp;nbsp;â€“ not the other way around. Now, this is in no way meant to underestimate the importance of design. Design can breathe life into the story the copy is telling, and done properly, great copy plus great design will always outperform great copy alone.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The point is, it's not hard to find examples of "ugly" pages outperforming beautifully designed pages â€“ and in those cases, it usually boils down to the copy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Copy first. Design second.&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We've been chatting about this a lot lately on HubSpot's marketing optimization team. In the past, our marketing team has typically followed a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;design first, copy second&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;order of operations when designing web pages. And it's hard to blame us. We try to move fast and ship projects quickly, and the design before copy approach is definitely the quicker of the two, since copy can be written in tandem with the development of the design.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when copywriting comes first, design can't even begin until copy is complete. And because development can't happen until&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;design&lt;/em&gt; is done, this definitely extends the timeline of project execution. The problem is, this means you're&amp;nbsp;crafting copy under the limitations of a fully baked design, handicapping your ability to tell the story in the best way possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now I'll admit: All this "copy before design" business always sounded great to me&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;in theory&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-conversion-rate-optimization-faqs"&gt;conversion rate optimization&lt;/a&gt; experts also warn against the dangers of "&lt;a class="external-link" href="https://austinknight.com/writing/the-road-to-mediocrity-is-paved-with-best-practices/"&gt;best practices&lt;/a&gt;," so it was really enlightening to find an example of this theory proven out on one of our very own web pages.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Experiment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In addition to our &lt;a class="external-link" href="https://offers.hubspot.com/free-trial"&gt;main free trial landing page&lt;/a&gt;, we also have a bunch of targeted, tool-specific free trial landing pages that the marketing team uses for more segmented campaigns. Below you'll find an example of one &lt;span&gt;(image B)&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;nbsp;which is targeted to specifically promote HubSpot's Blogging tool. And here are the two compared to each other ...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;A. Main Free Trial Landing Page (Above the Fold)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/main-free-trial-lp-1.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;name=main-free-trial-lp-1.png" class="alignCenter shadow" alt="main-free-trial-lp-1.png" width="640" style="width: 640px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;B. Tool-Specific Free Trial Landing Page (Above the Fold)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/blogging-free-trial.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;name=blogging-free-trial.png" class="alignCenter shadow" alt="blogging-free-trial.png" width="640" style="width: 640px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As you can see, these tool-specific landing pages were built using an older template, and when we redesigned our main free trial landing page to look the way it currently does, its&amp;nbsp;tool-specific counterparts remained in the former design. Seeing this as low-hanging fruit from a conversion perspective, I converted three of our most trafficked tool-specific free trial landing pages into the newer template. To be sure the newer design was still in fact the better&amp;nbsp;converting design, I A/B tested each page against&amp;nbsp;its pre-existing design.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Initial Results&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When I first analyzed the results of these three tests, the variation (i.e., the design using the newer template) only won for two of the three pages. Naturally, I tried to understand why. When I took a closer look at the third one (the&amp;nbsp;free trial landing page for our Keywords tool), I noticed a difference. Can you spot it?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Older Template (Control)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/old-keywords-trial.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;name=old-keywords-trial.png" class="alignCenter shadow" alt="old-keywords-trial.png" width="640" style="width: 640px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Newer Template (Variant)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/newer-template.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;name=newer-template.png" class="alignCenter shadow" alt="newer-template.png" width="640" style="width: 640px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Okay ... obviously there are a few differences here, considering the design is completely different. But the one that stuck out to me immediately was that the positioning of the header/subheader copy in the control was very different than that of the variant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4 style="line-height: 1em; text-align: center;"&gt;Control Header + Subheader Copy:&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center; line-height: 1em;"&gt;Find Out Which Keywords You (And Your Competitors) Rank For&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h4 style="line-height: 1.25em; text-align: center;"&gt;Variant Header + Subheader Copy:&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center; line-height: 1em;"&gt;Try HubSpot's Keywords Tool Free for 30 Days&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center; line-height: 1em;"&gt;Get found in search for the keywords that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="line-height: 1em;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The positioning&amp;nbsp;in the control was primarily focused on the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt; value&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; of the Keywords tool, specifically emphasizing the competitive intelligence the tool provides, whereas the positioning in the variant was focused on clarifying what the offer was itself (i.e., a free, 30-day trial). And while I had made sure the variant still mentioned the competitive intelligence value of the Keywords tool, I had buried it lower down on the page ... below the fold.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 style="line-height: 1em;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Isolating Variables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The problem with this test was that I wasn't isolating the variable I was trying to prove. In this case, I wanted to prove that the new design for the page performed better than the existing design, yet I was manipulating more than one variable: design&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; copy. So after I had my "duh" moment, I decided to tweak the positioning in the header copy of the variant to match the control, and let the test run for a few more weeks. This way I'd be doing a better job of isolating design as the variable I was testing.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here's what the header and subheader copy in the control and variant looked like after I tweaked the variant. Note that I made no changes to the copy in the control ...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4 style="line-height: 1em; text-align: center;"&gt;Control Header + Subheader Copy:&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center; line-height: 1em;"&gt;Find Out Which Keywords You (And Your Competitors) Rank For&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center; line-height: 1em;"&gt;Instantly access SEO data with HubSpot's Keywords tool by starting a 30-day free trial.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4 style="line-height: 1.25em; text-align: center;"&gt;Variant Header + Subheader Copy:&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center; line-height: 1em;"&gt;Find Out Which Keywords You &amp;amp; Your Competitors Rank For&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;And here's how it looked in each template variation ...&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Older Template&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/original-copy-old-template.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;name=original-copy-old-template.png" alt="original-copy-old-template.png" width="640" style="width: 640px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 style="text-align: center;"&gt;Newer Template&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/original-copy-new-template.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;name=original-copy-new-template.png" alt="original-copy-new-template.png" width="640" style="width: 640px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Results&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A few weeks after making those tweaks, I re-evaluated my test.&amp;nbsp;Bingo!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The variant was the new winner with 99.07% confidence and a 20% increase in conversion over the control.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Aside from the fact that this was (ultimately) a successful test, what I love is&amp;nbsp;that it proves how influential copy can be. The only reason the control originally outperformed the variation was because people preferred&amp;nbsp;the copy in the control -- even though the design of the variant ultimately performed better.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So there you have it: Don't underestimate copywriting in favor of design. In fact, copywriting can be even more influential than design when it comes to conversion rate optimization.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thereâ€™s no denying it: Blogging for your business works. According to our &lt;a href="http://www.stateofinbound.com/?_ga=1.232164953.7546083.1477915232"&gt;2016 State of Inbound&lt;/a&gt; report, B2B marketers who blog receive &lt;strong&gt;67% more leads&lt;/strong&gt; than those who donâ€™t, and marketers who have prioritized blogging are &lt;strong&gt;13X more likely to enjoy positive ROI.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Blogging is a crucial part of inbound marketing because it allows you to quickly disseminate helpful information to your followers and new site visitors, which, in turn, helps build credibility, SEO juice, and helps you become more of a thought leader in your industry.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Blogging is a crucial part of inbound marketing because it allows you to quickly disseminate helpful information to your followers and new site visitors, which, in turn, helps build credibility, SEO juice, and helps you become more of a thought leader in your industry. Best of all, blogging is super cost-effective, because the only thing you need to spend is &lt;em&gt;time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But despite all of the advantages that focused blogging can net businesses, some marketers balk at the time commitment required. Theyâ€™re not wrong -- launching and maintaining a blog isnâ€™t a one-day task. In fact, youâ€™ll need plenty of planning, resources, and good old-fashioned effort to gain adequate ROI.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thatâ€™s why HubSpot and General Assembly have teamed up to create the new 10-week planner, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-start-a-successful-blog"&gt;How to Start a Successful Blog in 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. It's got tips on:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Psychological Safety Creates the Best Teams</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/collaboration-psychological-safety</link>
      <description>
        &lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/collaboration-psychological-safety" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/00-Blog_Thinkstock_Images/psychological-safety-1.png?t=1483790613555" alt="How Psychological Safety Creates the Best Teams" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When it comes to devising solutions to challenging problems, a room full of bright minds working towards a common goal is almost always more effective than working alone.&lt;/p&gt;
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/00-Blog_Thinkstock_Images/psychological-safety-1.png?t=1483790613555"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When it comes to devising solutions to challenging problems, a room full of bright minds working towards a common goal is almost always more effective than working alone.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Under the belief that the composition of a group influences the quality of its work, Google has spent years hunting for the key to what makes teams truly great. The tech giant is known for tapping its prodigious brainpower to solve complex problems with creative solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whether it's revolutionizing search, email, or exploring the possibilities of driverless cars, Google provides a welcome example of a company focused on maximizing the potential of collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Project Aristotle&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Over the past five years, Google has been engaged in an extensive undertaking to engineer the most productive groups possible. This endeavor, referred to as &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html"&gt;Project Aristotle&lt;/a&gt;, involved years of extensive observations of how employees at Google collaborate in group settings, according to &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Project Aristotle's findings suggest that many of the factors we'd expect to influence the outcome of a project actually didn't actually have a significant impact on whether or not the group was successful.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Having a shared versus designated leadership structure, including employees from diverse employment backgrounds, and whether or not group members socialized outside of work did not necessarily determine a group's chances of success.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Overall, there was one central trend which appeared in almost every successful group: &lt;strong&gt;feelings of psychological safety.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Psychological safety, &lt;a href="http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=e55fd191-97da-4b52-a54d-d1ae6abb0a6e%40sessionmgr111&amp;amp;vid=1&amp;amp;hid=115&amp;amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=2003235&amp;amp;db=bth"&gt;according to Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson&lt;/a&gt;, is the "shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking," and "a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up."&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the majority of successful groups Google studied, participants identified feeling comfortable sharing ideas and asking questions. These feelings of psychological safety were not unique to any type of group or leadership dynamic. As Charles Duhigg &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html"&gt;wrote in the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, the most productive teams listened to -- and were respectful of -- the ideas, feelings, beliefs and suggestions of their peers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Early Education as a Model&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The corporate model of psychological safety is not all that different than the one you had in grade school. When students are comfortable enough to share their ideas freely and don't feel afraid of being rejected, they are able to &lt;a href="http://www.scilearn.com/blog/creating-safe-learning-environments-increase-student-performance"&gt;learn better and take interpersonal risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While businesses and elementary schools are certainly not universally comparable environments, &lt;strong&gt;the importance of ideological and interpersonal safety is universally paramount&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To make a space safe for intellectual exploration, agencies must make concerted efforts to foster an open atmosphere of acceptance. As discussed in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhoLuui9gX8"&gt;2014 TED Talk&lt;/a&gt; by Harvard Business School professor and author Dr. Amy C. Edmondson, individuals are often very worried about appearing incompetent or ignorant, and thus are more likely to keep their questions and ideas to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This not only stifles an individual's creative potential, it also limits the potential for innovation in collaborative group settings. Imagine trying to learn new skills or ways of working in an environment where it's intimidating to admit what you don't know, much less share ideas that challenge established norms.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In competitive agency environments built on creative critique, often only a few leaders make decisions on ideas, clearly limiting the potential voice and contribution of team members.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With participation from more team members comes more ideas -- and quite possibly a better product. Expanding critique and other opportunities requires that employees feel safe to speak up and participate within groups.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Applying Psychological Safety at Agencies&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maintaining an open and safe dialogue often goes against the grain of both corporate culture and human nature, but the companies that will thrive in the coming years will do so through their collective creativity and ability to innovate, rather than relying on the opinions of a few individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Almost paradoxically, to survive in the ever-increasing competitive environment of today's digital economy, agencies need to create intellectual safe havens that are more akin to your third grade classroom than any scene in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men"&gt;AMC's Mad Men&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sweeping organizational culture shifts will not occur overnight, but change can start tomorrow. Here are five steps to start fostering a safe, productive workplace:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1) Stop the unhealthy practice of responding to new ideas with unproductive negativity.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You do not have to love every idea your peers put forward, but demeaning the idea and its creator is unnecessary, counterproductive and sometimes downright hurtful.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/02-062_0b5726a8-443d-4629-9e75-736679b870fc.pdf"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; and personal experience tell us that sometimes we don't voice our opinions because we fear embarrassment, looking dumb or feeling intellectually inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;2) Always celebrate good ideas.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is the counter approach to the previously mentioned unproductive behavior. The merit of this step applies for both teams and individuals. But seriously, who doesn't appreciate being complimented for their hard work?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;3) Acknowledge that the entire team effort goes into good work.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Great ideas, regardless of size, often come about because of the genius and hard work of at least a handful of people. So, when celebrating new ideas and innovative work, recognize the whole team, not just the manager or creative with the highest title.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;4) Get those in power on board with psychological safety.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While change does not always have to come from the top, the behavior that managers, directors and executives model directly impacts and influences the actions of those below them. Therefore, change is only sustainable with a commitment from those in power.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;5) Break down organizational silos to promote collaboration, communication and progress.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is not to say everyone must work equally on all projects, but rather that teams should consider themselves multidisciplinary so employees of varying titles feel comfortable contributing. Organizations with healthy interpersonal relationships are more likely to have uninhibited idea sharing, increased collaboration and a better end result.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Content Marketing in the Professional Services Industry</title>

        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/using-content-marketing-professional-services" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/ThinkstockPhotos-179768055-848177-edited.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="ThinkstockPhotos-179768055-848177-edited.jpg" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Your content marketing strategy should be approached a little differently if your business offers professional services, like practicing law, medicine, or performing some form of consulting work.&lt;/p&gt;
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ThinkstockPhotos-179768055-848177-edited.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;height=302&amp;amp;name=ThinkstockPhotos-179768055-848177-edited.jpg" alt="ThinkstockPhotos-179768055-848177-edited.jpg" width="730" height="302"&gt;Your content marketing strategy should be approached a little differently if your business offers professional services, like practicing law, medicine, or performing some form of consulting work.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is because youâ€™re largely capitalizing on expertise to serve your clients, not just pushing product benefits. Demonstrating that expertise is going to be crucial to building trust with your audience, which in turn leads to inbound inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That being said, letâ€™s nail down who your audiences are, since there are actually TWO primary groups youâ€™ll want to target. From there, weâ€™ll look at some tactical strategies you can employ to start using content marketing for professional services on different media channels.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;First Up: Who Are You Attracting?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;â€œClientsâ€ is the obvious answer here. Youâ€™re definitely going to need messages going straight to the people who are going to be writing checks for you. Itâ€™s the other, not-so-obvious target that may actually bring the most value to your business development, however: referral partners. This group is going to be made up of professionals just like you. They wonâ€™t be in the same industry (those are competitors), but tangential ones. Here are a couple of examples of these symbiotic, â€œyou help me, I help youâ€ relationships:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Estate Attorney + Financial Planner&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Cardiac Surgeon + Family Practice Physician&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Business Consultant + Enterprise Software Salesperson&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You can see a trend in these relationships, where one professional is usually a specialist and the other provides more general services. In the case of the first example, a single financial planner may have a variety of go-to attorneys in different practice areas so they can best serve their client when the need for legal assistance arises. Alternatively, the estate attorney probably has relationships with a number of financial planners in the same role, so that he or she is maximizing the probability of a referral coming through. Think about which role you can play for your network - the generalist or specialist.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;table style="height: 447px;" width="398"&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td style="width: 397px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/465783/BKendrick_Guest/fish-climb-tree.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="fish-climb-tree.jpg" width="100%" title="fish-climb-tree.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don't think you're fooling anyone, fish. We all know you swim better than you climb. Stick with what you're good at!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In both cases of communication (client or referral partner), the main goal is to advocate that you have the audienceâ€™s best interests at heart. For clients, that means solving their problems thoroughly and quickly. Referral partners are going to need assurance that you know what youâ€™re doing, and, when they hand off their client, that youâ€™re going to reflect positively on themâ€¦ by solving the clientâ€™s problems thoroughly and quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, you and I know that youâ€™re wholly capable of meeting those needs without a problem. The issue is that they donâ€™t know. In content marketing for professional services, your main goal for messaging is to demonstrate that youâ€™re the expert. Another name for this type of communication is authority positioning.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;How to Show that Youâ€™re Top Dog&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;table style="height: 370px;" width="347"&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td style="width: 346px;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/465783/BKendrick_Guest/top-dog-smile.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="top-dog-smile.jpg" width="100%" title="top-dog-smile.jpg"&gt; &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;Fact: When you're on top, you tend to smile more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are three primary messages that fall under the umbrella of authority positioning. The overarching intent of getting your messages out there is to draw attention to your business, but each message actually has its own sub-objective for showing that youâ€™re the market expert. Letâ€™s look at these types, then expand on the best ways to deliver each to your audience.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Authority Message #1: Tips &amp;amp; Advice&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This first one is a no-brainer. How can you best show that you know the solution to a problem? By sharing that solution! You have the perfect sample to draw from when identifying these problems, too: real-life, existing clients.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Every now and then youâ€™ll work with a completely unique and challenging case, but for the most part, a lot of people (read: more than youâ€™re currently working with) are asking the same core questions. Offering answers to common client questions helps you capitalize on where theyâ€™re already looking. As for those unique curveballs, share the occasional example to show that you can overcome any problem. Theyâ€™ll also help differentiate you and keep your content interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sub-Objective:&lt;/strong&gt; Show that youâ€™re ready and willing to be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Authority Message #2: Case Studies&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you share advice, some content will click for your audience and be useful just based on context. The majority of clients and referral partners are going to need some more convincing, however.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Case studies act as a vehicle for you to deliver concrete evidence that your services have helped others. In a more subtle way, they also serve as a testament to your process and show that youâ€™re results-driven. If youâ€™re keeping track of your clientsâ€™ success, it means you care about the actual outcomes - not just about signing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sub-Objective:&lt;/strong&gt; Show that you care about the end result - and that you can achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Authority Message #3: Analysis of Relevant Current Events&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Considering the events of 2016, the world is crazy and literally anything can happen. That has an effect on your clients. Take a fixed event, like, I donâ€™t know, the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Without even taking a political stance, itâ€™s easy to see that a central event like that sends out ripples in every direction, holding implications for economics and lifestyle changes for pretty much everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you can think critically about what that event can mean for your clients, you can deliver some professional insights on the subject. That way, youâ€™re capitalizing on a hot conversational topic and demonstrating your problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sub-Objective:&lt;/strong&gt; Show that youâ€™re in touch with whatâ€™s impacting clientsâ€™ lives, and that youâ€™re prepared serve in any situation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now even if you build these types of messages, you have to make sure your audience is going to see them. Starting an advice column in your local paper may be an option, but unless youâ€™re specifically aiming to serve just local folks, youâ€™re going to want to try some different channels.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;How to Spread the Word&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While the messaging may be unique when youâ€™re looking at content marketing for professional services vs. something like e-commerce, youâ€™re going to use similar platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Remember, you want to put your message in a spot where the right people are already looking. That means capitalizing on SEO via website content, weighing in on social media, and promoting your business at events that are concentrated hubs for building your referral network.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Blogging&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Writing blog articles with specific content in response to a highly-trafficked keyword is still going to be your best bet for getting seen organically. We havenâ€™t incorporated Google into our lexicon as a verb for no reason, people.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The best way that you can explain what your business does and how you can serve clients is by directing them to your website. Write up blogs that fit into the messaging types described above, and then include links in them that lead to the next useful piece of information.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;table style="height: 312px;" width="422"&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td style="width: 421px;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/465783/hubfs/BKendrick_Guest/all-roads-lead.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=492&amp;amp;name=all-roads-lead.jpg" alt="all-roads-lead.jpg" width="492" title="all-roads-lead.jpg"&gt; &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just like the Arc de Triomphe, all roads should lead to one place: the sale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Depending on the topic youâ€™ve written about, you can send visitors to another useful blog topic and continue to build trust, or get them to a conversion point, if theyâ€™re ready. Putting your case studies into a downloadable PDF format and gating them behind a form is a good way to do that if theyâ€™re still not ready to schedule a consultation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you donâ€™t currently have a blog set up on your website, the LinkedIn Publishing tool is a good workaround, though youâ€™re going to be limiting your audience to only people active on LinkedIn. Even if you do have a blog, itâ€™s a good idea to use LinkedIn for any topics that are focused on attracting referral partners.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Social Media Posting&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Speaking of LinkedInâ€™s usefulness for network building, LinkedIn Groups are also a powerful medium for reaching specific professional groups. You can find a Group in your own market and use it as a collaboration platform to overcome tricky client problems, but consider moving to ones outside your industry.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Remember from the first section, professionals in tangential fields are going to be good candidates for referral sources. Head into one of those threads and share your own (relevant!!!) posts to generate traffic, or comment on othersâ€™ posts to build familiarity until you can start a conversation with them one-on-one.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To speak directly to your clients, sharing your advice articles will be great on Facebook or Twitter, but thatâ€™s the same old stuff you already know. If you want to go the extra mile, consider shooting some videos where you talk through specific client problems and post them to YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Video continues to rise in popularity as a content medium, and it helps clients get a better feel for who you really are than any article can. The best part is that, while you want to be wary of things like good lighting and sound quality, you donâ€™t need studio access to make a decent clip - just grab a colleague and use your smartphoneâ€™s camera. Make sure they shoot horizontally, though!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Events &amp;amp; Webinars&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Weâ€™ve all been attending grand events like HubSpotâ€™s INBOUND conference for years, hoping to come away with some nuggets of knowledge that can enhance our businesses. Attendees all view the speakers at those events as thought leaders and pioneers in their space. So if thatâ€™s your own goal, how about you host one of those talks?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/465783/hubfs/BKendrick_Guest/trip-onstage.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=420&amp;amp;name=trip-onstage.png" alt="trip-onstage.png" width="420" title="trip-onstage.png"&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pay no attention to the haters, people. You can do it. Source: SomeEECards (someeecards.com)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Granted, thereâ€™s always an application process, and speaking in front of a ballroom of people is intimidating. Itâ€™s not for everyone. Webinars, however, are a lot easier to manage and execute, and they make gathering registrantsâ€™ information very simple.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The important part thatâ€™s often forgotten, however, is that you want to stick to your authority message. Do not pitch your services, except maybe right near the end. Webinars and speaking events are the perfect platforms to actually do some educating and establish yourself as a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finally, if speaking isnâ€™t really your gig, simply attend some webinars or events where you already have some knowledge on the subject. From there, you can use a webinar chat tool or just do some live Tweeting to add commentary to the subjects presented. Show that you understand the presenter, and share takeaways with the group.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This way, youâ€™re participating in the conversation, assisting members of your network who arenâ€™t attending, and catching the attention of people seeking answers who you have yet to connect with. This works best if the event has an associated hashtag for attendees to join the conversation, since you know youâ€™ll catch someoneâ€™s eye in that shared space.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/465783/hubfs/BKendrick_Guest/fallon-hashtag.gif?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=360&amp;amp;name=fallon-hashtag.gif" alt="fallon-hashtag.gif" width="360" title="fallon-hashtag.gif"&gt; &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jimmy knows how to live tweet. Source: Giphy (giphy.com)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Follow the Expertâ€™s Lead&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I searched pretty heartily for examples of businesses who are executing these techniques really well, and found a great model in &lt;a href="http://www.practicealchemy.com/"&gt;Practice Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;. Practice Alchemy is a niche marketing firm run by legal experts, and they apply their industry knowledge to help law firms to build a marketing strategy. Itâ€™s apparent that they practice what they preach. At the head of Practice Alchemy is Raj Jha, a former Silicon Valley attorney and clear thought leader in his space.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thatâ€™s right, clear thought leader. You know it from the second you land on the website because of all the information sharing Practice Alchemy has done. They have an extensive resource library that lawyers can look to for actionable information, including a &lt;a href="http://www.practicealchemy.com/download-complete-guide-marketing-strategy-law-firm"&gt;Complete Guide to Building a Marketing Strategy at Your Law Firm&lt;/a&gt;. They have a blog full of more than 150 articles, all of which are clearly made for their appropriate audience (lawyers at small law firms). Raj has even hosted a number of videos online to position Practice Alchemy as an authority - and even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb7wzbZJmH8"&gt;has one that explains exactly how to do that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Seriously, though, if there are any lawyers reading this, youâ€™re going to want to download that Complete Guide:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The biggest takeaway that you can draw from this article and from Practice Alchemyâ€™s example is that content marketing for professional services is not about pitching and closing (still important, but thatâ€™s sales). Instead, itâ€™s about sharing expertise and just showing that you give a damn about whether the client - or referral partner - is successful. If you centralize your marketing communications around that goal, youâ€™re almost guaranteed to find success yourself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="cta_button" href="https://offers.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=70c10ef9-ff55-46e9-a9ad-690de66e509f&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid="&gt; &lt;img class="hs-cta-img " style="border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; " alt="New Call-to-action" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/70c10ef9-ff55-46e9-a9ad-690de66e509f.png"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If you're anything like I am, you have mixed feelings about New Year's resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It seems like a natural time to make important changes. It's like a universal pressing of the "reset" button. Maybe that's why &lt;a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/"&gt;45% of Americans make New Year's resolutions&lt;/a&gt; in the first place. But here's the thing -- only &lt;a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/"&gt;8% of us are successful in achieving them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/professional-new-years-resolutions.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;height=302&amp;amp;name=professional-new-years-resolutions.jpg" alt="professional-new-years-resolutions.jpg" width="730" height="302"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you're anything like I am, you have mixed feelings about New Year's resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It seems like a natural time to make important changes. It's like a universal pressing of the "reset" button. Maybe that's why &lt;a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/"&gt;45% of Americans make New Year's resolutions&lt;/a&gt; in the first place. But here's the thing -- only &lt;a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/"&gt;8% of us are successful in achieving them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We suspect it has something to do with the nature of the resolutions themselves. According to a study by the University of Scranton's &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/"&gt;the top 10 resolutions of 2015 included things like losing weight and falling in love&lt;/a&gt;. And sure, those goals are great -- we're all about being happy and healthy -- but will they make you better at what you do every day? &lt;a class="cta_button" href="https://offers.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=a482387e-c9f6-456b-b92f-4ba795780b19&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid="&gt; &lt;img class="hs-cta-img " style="border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; " alt="Download&amp;nbsp;our free planning template to establish concrete and achievable  marketing goals." src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a482387e-c9f6-456b-b92f-4ba795780b19.png"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Next year, we challenge you to come up with and stick to professional New Year's resolutions -- things that will make you more creative, productive, and generally more content at work. Short on ideas? Here are 12 of ours to help you get started, along with resources to help you actually accomplish them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;12 New Year's Resolutions for Professionals&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1) Designate an electronics-free zone.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Our bodies are smarter than you might think. They're trained to respond to light and dark, which according to the &lt;a href="https://sleepfoundation.org/ask-the-expert/electronics-the-bedroom"&gt;National Sleep Foundation&lt;/a&gt; send us important signals, like the time of day. Those signals also aid our bodies in adjusting our circadian rhythms -- that's the handy 24-hour physiological cycle that helps us fall asleep at night and wake up in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All of that is pretty cool ... until screens are added to the equation. Our brains recognize the brightness from phones, computer monitors, and even TVs as external light, which sends the signal that we should be awake. That's why &lt;a href="https://sleepfoundation.org/ask-the-expert/electronics-the-bedroom/page/0/1"&gt;it's harder for so many of us to fall asleep when we're exposed to too much screen time at night&lt;/a&gt;. The verdict? Put the devices down before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcNXNtydKSY"&gt;INBOUND 2013&lt;/a&gt;, Arianna Huffington -- who later went on to pen &lt;em&gt;The Sleep Revolution &lt;/em&gt;-- gave some great advice regarding the sleep/screen conundrum: Ban electronics from your bedroom for good.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"I never take devices to bed," she said. "iPads, iPhones, Blackberries -- I don't charge them near my bed, because I feel it's imperative to be able to have uninterrupted renewal time."&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This habit is a tough one to break, and it's one that I've personally been working on for years. So if you like to watch movies or shows on your computer before bed, for example, I can relate -- these are the mindless things that help us unwind at the end of the day. Luckily, there are solutions to help you resolve the problem for good, some of which might still allow you to indulge in your evening TV viewing.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Helpful Resources&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We'd encourage you to ditch the electronics completely before bed. Instead, try reading, journaling, or maybe even a few minutes of yoga. And if you absolutely cannot part with your electronics:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Try downloading a desktop app that reduces your screen's &lt;a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side"&gt;blue light&lt;/a&gt; as the day progresses -- that's the kind emitted from most electronics and is often cited as the culprit for sleep loss. We recommend &lt;a href="https://justgetflux.com/" style="background-color: transparent; font-family: proxima-nova, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1em;"&gt;f.lux&lt;/a&gt;, which adjusts your screen's blue light depending on the time of day, or the similar filter from &lt;a href="http://www.thomson-software-solutions.com/pc-sun-screen/"&gt;PC Sun Screen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Plus, the latest iPhone OS now comes with a "&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202613"&gt;night shift&lt;/a&gt;" mode, which accomplishes the same thing after sunset.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;2) Write something every day.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Why?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sadly, the decreasing &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-americans-cant-write/2015/09/24/6e7f420a-6088-11e5-9757-e49273f05f65_story.html?utm_term=.1b6e5bbead3e"&gt;quality of writing in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; has been making headlines for a while now. And people &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to become better writers -- they just have trouble investing the necessary time.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But it's an important skill. And if you're going to be blogging regularly -- which we recommend you do -- the writing needs to be good.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you want to become a better writer, then you need to write &lt;em&gt;a lot.&lt;/em&gt; The way to improve that skill is the same way you'd approach any other -- with practice.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It's the same advice we give to people who want to blog more consistently (another worthy New Year's resolution) which is to treat it like working out. You've got to do it consistently to see great results. After all, you can't just publish a blog once every few months and expect to rack up views, leads, and customers. The same goes for your overall writing skills.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;How?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To start, get into the habit of writing on a daily basis. &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/habits-great-writers"&gt;Neil Patel suggests&lt;/a&gt; writing for at least 30 minutes every workday, skipping the weekends. Remember the advice we just gave to journal before bed, instead of looking at a screen? Here's a great way to put that time to use.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And even if you don't identify as a writer, pick a question -- something from a customer, a friend, or a topic that's always piqued your curiosity -- and write something about it. Or, just write nonsense. It's the habit of writing regularly that's important, especially in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Helpful Resources&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When we encourage people to write more, one of the most common objections is, "I have nothing to say." We profoundly disagree, and thought that these tools might help to generate some ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dailypage.co/"&gt;Daily Page&lt;/a&gt;: Emails you a writing prompt every morning, and you have the rest of the day to write your response. Once you've written your response to the prompt, you can either share it or keep it private.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://750words.com/"&gt;750 Words&lt;/a&gt;: Encourages you to write 750 words per day about anything you want. It gamifies writing by giving you points for writing at all, for writing 750 words or more, and for writing on a consistent basis.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://twords.2lch.com/"&gt;Twords&lt;/a&gt;: Calls itself "the app that nudges you to write." It notifies you when you haven't written in a while so you can keep yourself accountable -- and even gives you the option to connect with others who will help you stay on track.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/fall-in-love-with-writing#sm.0000e1w1nuwvbeo5sq61j1tim2kyj"&gt;How to Fall in Love With Writing Again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/professional-new-years-resolutions?hs_preview=mGSPGNrs-4561655531#sm.0000e1w1nuwvbeo5sq61j1tim2kyj"&gt;How to Train Your Brain to Write More Concisely: 6 Creative Exercises to Try&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;3) Keep up with Google.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Why?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Google likes to make changes to its algorithm as much as certain pop singers like to change boyfriends. But all of them are made to improve user experience, which is a good thing -- it helps searchers discover the best content for what they're seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This year, we challenge you to really keep up with those changes. That doesn't just mean staying on top of news about the latest changes. It also means keeping your content at the highest quality to make Google's algorithm happy, which means more people will be able to find you. Win-win.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;How?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Consider reorganizing your content library into content clusters since &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/topic-clusters"&gt;SEO is evolving to favor topics over keywords&lt;/a&gt; according to Matthew Barby, global head of growth and SEO at HubSpot. That will help you harness more search traffic, because you'll have a larger pool of relevant keywords and phrases to be discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In general, it's a good idea to regularly revisit and refresh your content strategy, too. Not only does it prevent your content from getting stale, but it also helps you to keep up with what people are searching for, which in turn will help you keep pace with Google.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;4) Improve your design skills.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Why?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In case you haven't heard, visual content is a pretty big deal in marketing. For one thing, &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?_ga=1.91812506.1053898511.1470656920"&gt;it's 40x more likely to be shared on social media&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?_ga=1.91812506.1053898511.1470656920"&gt;when a relevant image is paired with information, people retain 55% more of that information after three days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;But quality visual content goes beyond a Google image search or &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/most-searched-for-free-stock-photos?_ga=1.66188718.1053898511.1470656920"&gt;stock photography&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, however, not everyone has an ample design budget. For that reason, we believe that 2017 is the year for you to master some design skills. That will allow you to create the content yourself -- or, if you do have a bigger budget, learn to better communicate with contractors and agencies that create it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;How?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These days, learning a new skill has become its own industry. Never before have there been so many online resources -- many of which are either free or relatively inexpensive -- to &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/resources-to-learn-seo"&gt;self-educate&lt;/a&gt;. And many of them are available outside of the classroom, like on YouTube how-to videos, &lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org"&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.khanacademy.org"&gt;Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If your company has something like a tuition reimbursement program, here's a great opportunity to take advantage of that benefit. Many community colleges offer design courses, some of which are taught in the evenings. Do a local search for these classes in your area, and find out what's available -- it might not be too late to enroll for the next semester.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;5) Invest in video.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Why?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;First of all, by investing in and experimenting with video, you would be joining the &lt;a href="http://www.stateofinbound.com/?__hstc=20629287.857e77756cee829a859f9012da7eee4e.1469131805634.1480962626992.1480964623252.116&amp;amp;__hssc=20629287.12.1480973207888&amp;amp;__hsfp=3607161447"&gt;48% of marketers who plan to add YouTube to their content strategies&lt;/a&gt; in the next year. Other than that, we'll let some more &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;numbers&lt;/a&gt; do the talking:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;4x as many customers would rather watch a video about a product than read about it.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;45% of people watch more than an hour of Facebook or YouTube videos a week.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Marketers who use video grow revenue 49% faster than non-video users.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;How?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Getting started with a video strategy depends on your level of knowledge. If you haven't yet, for example, it could he helpful to brush up on your video editing skills, and find out which platforms are the best for your current marketing needs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It's also a good idea to learn about the different ways video marketing works. In addition to learning how to produce higher-quality content of this kind for YouTube and certain social posts, you might want to look into experimenting with instant video options, like Facebook Live, and Instagram or Snapchat Stories. These more casual formats help people relate to your brand by giving them a behind-the-scenes look at what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;6) Take breaks.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Why?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Despite &lt;a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/infographs/breakroom-2014-infographic.html"&gt;90% of employers encouraging breaks, it seems that only 45% of us are okay with taking them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So what's with the other 55%? It turns out that &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/guilt-sabotage-work#sm.0000e1w1nuwvbeo5sq61j1tim2kyj"&gt;we're too guilty to leave our desks for prolonged breaks&lt;/a&gt; -- we're afraid that it'll make us look less productive, or take away time that could be used to get work done.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But it turns out that the opposite is true. In fact, &lt;a href="http://blog.desktime.com/2014/08/20/the-secret-of-the-10-most-productive-people-breaking/"&gt;the top 10% most productive employees take 17-minute breaks for every 52 minutes of work they put in&lt;/a&gt;. There's tremendous value in breaks, and we could all stand to benefit from them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;How?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When we're "in the zone," so to speak, it's easy to forget to come up for air. That's why I take the advice of that top 10%, and actually put reminders in my calendar to take a 17-minute break every 52 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;During those 17 minutes, I completely step away from work -- no email, no work-related calls, and whenever possible, no sneak peeks at my phone. And during those 52 minutes of work? That's your time for hyper focus. Close those tabs that you have open to check social media -- unless you're using it for work, that is -- and remind yourself that there's a break coming.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Podcasting is a thriving mini-industry. It's no wonder -- listening to podcasts is a great way to learn something new without it being a direct skill you are mastering.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That's true from an early age, which is why many teachers are also incorporating podcasts into their lesson plans. In fact, &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/the-benefits-of-podcasts-in-class/473925/"&gt;one English teacher found that assigning the &lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt; podcast to his students helped them pay more attention to the written word&lt;/a&gt;. While listening to any given episode, he reported that their eyes became affixed to its written transcript. In other words, it seemed the auditory version of a story aided their ability to process accompanying written content.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And maybe that's why the popularity of podcast-based lesson plans &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/where-are-all-the-kidcasts/476157/"&gt;increased by a whopping &lt;strong&gt;650%&lt;/strong&gt; in 2015&lt;/a&gt; -- the year after &lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt; first launched. It's not just that podcasts themselves are tremendously informative (which they are). As it turns out, they might even enhance your skills in other areas, too.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;How?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A simple app download can go a long way when you're aiming to discover more valuable podcasts. We particularly like &lt;a href="https://www.stitcher.com/"&gt;Stitcher&lt;/a&gt;, which catalogues over 65,000 podcasts and allows you to curate your own listening collection, depending on your subject interests. Whether you're looking to become a better marketer or a better cook, chances are, there's a podcast out there that can help.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;8) Ask for help.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Why?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In 2014, &lt;a href="http://cdn-care.com/img/cms/web/infographics/caredotcom-working-moms-stress-infographic.jpg"&gt;Care.com&lt;/a&gt; took a survey of working mothers that was quite eye-opening. Among the more surprising findings was one about the concept of asking for help -- something that 29% of respondents felt guilty about doing, especially when it came to things at home.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;At the same time, however, 79% also felt like they were falling behind at work, and 75% saw an overall reduction in stress when they &lt;em&gt;did &lt;/em&gt;enlist help.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These numbers go beyond working mothers, however. It seems that there's &lt;a href="http://www.onpoint-leadership.com/2016/09/real-fear-asking-help/"&gt;an epidemic of fear when it comes to asking for help at work&lt;/a&gt;. Many of us sense that asking questions about an assignment, for example, will make us look like we weren't paying attention, or aren't as smart as our peers thought. But when we don't ask questions, we're actually setting ourselves up for failure, by forcing completion of a task without all of the necessary information.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;How?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This resolution is one that actually begins with management. On my very first day at HubSpot, my boss said something to me that I will never forget: â€œIâ€™ll help you with whatever you ask me for help with. The most successful people ask for help when they need it!â€&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you're a manager, think about how often your team is asking for your help. If you're not receiving a lot of questions, you might want to send a similar message. By setting that tone, your team is aware that it's okay if they don't know everything.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And on the flip side, don't be afraid to ask for help. It's more likely than not that the person you need it from is happy to answer your questions.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;9) Develop a mobile strategy.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Why?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you don't have a mobile strategy yet, it's time.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;2016 was a pivotal year for mobile, and it's only going to get more important in 2017. In August, &lt;a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/"&gt;Google announced that it would be cracking down on invasive mobile pop-ups&lt;/a&gt;. On top of that, the use of voice search via mobile and personal assistant devices is on the rise, with Google Voice Search queries seeing a &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/kleinerperkins/2016-internet-trends-report/122-KPCB_INTERNET_TRENDS_2016_PAGE122Google"&gt;3400% increase since 2008&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, we've witnessed the launch of Google's AMP, or &lt;a href="https://www.ampproject.org/"&gt;Accelerated Mobile Pages&lt;/a&gt;, in which certain pages are optimized for mobile in a way that allows them to load instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you haven't truly invested the resources to learn about mobile and adapted your marketing strategy accordingly, it's time to sit down and develop a strong mobile strategy, which means overhauling your website, emails, social accounts, blog, and any other online content to be mobile-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;How?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You might have to go back to the very basics on this one. When it comes to mobile optimization, a lot of it has to do with SEO these days. That is, if your content isn't optimized for mobile platforms and searches, your ranking could take a massive hit.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Start by brushing up on the &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-brief-history-of-search-seo#sm.0000e1w1nuwvbeo5sq61j1tim2kyj"&gt;history of SEO&lt;/a&gt;, or learning more about &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-algorithm-facts"&gt;Google's algorithm&lt;/a&gt;. From there, you can start getting into the nitty-gritty of mobile strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;10) Use your vacation time.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Why?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, there's a phenomenon out there known as "vacation shaming" -- the act of being made to feel guilty about going on vacation by managers, colleagues, or ourselves. No wonder &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/guilt-sabotage-work#sm.0000e1w1nuwvbeo5sq61j1tim2kyj"&gt;47% of us feel shame or guilt at work for taking time off&lt;/a&gt; -- it's mostly because &lt;a href="http://www.projecttimeoff.com/research/overwhelmed-america#Key%20Findings"&gt;we're afraid it'll make us look less dedicated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That's actually not how it works at all. It turns out that taking time off actually makes us &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; productive. In fact, in regions where people tend to take more vacation -- like Brazil and Sweden, where paid time off is mandatory -- &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2015/06/are-we-more-productive-when-we-have-more-time-off"&gt;employees tend to bring greater urgency to their work&lt;/a&gt;. That's probably because, according to the &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2015/06/are-we-more-productive-when-we-have-more-time-off"&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt;, â€œspending less time at your desk forces you to waste less time.â€ Makes sense, doesn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;How?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Vacation aiding productivity echoes the research done about how breaks help us as work. The biggest requirement is planning. Have a look at your calendar, and figure out when you'll be the busiest. Are there certain weeks when you'll have a little more time to get ahead? Those are good pre-vacation weeks, since they'll allow you to increase your output before you head out.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here's where that resolution to ask for help can be put to use, too. In addition to planning your own workload, ask the same of your colleagues. If there are certain weeks when they're able to fill in on your behalf, that might be a good time for you to plan a vacation. But that goes both ways -- make sure they're aware of when you're available to pitch in, too.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;11) Read more.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Why?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The most successful people never stop learning. There's a reason why &lt;a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=89"&gt;70% of adults in professional or managerial roles continue their education&lt;/a&gt; -- it's one of the best ways to keep up with industry trends, learn from experts, and get the creative juices flowing.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to do that outside of a classroom is to read what others are writing about. Reading more might even help you become a better writer, and exploring external content helps you to gain different perspectives of vital issues, whether they're of personal or professional interest.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;How?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The tough thing is, since there's so much content out there, you have to be discerning to find the really good stuff. To start, three places where content quality stays high are &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://hbr.org/"&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/"&gt;the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/"&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;(Donâ€™t be afraid to pay for top-tier content, by the way. Thereâ€™s a reason it costs money, and itâ€™s often well worth it.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You'll want to spend time reading more niche or industry-specific content, too. To make it easier to read them all, look for applications that let you read all your favorites all in one place, like &lt;a href="http://feedly.com"&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Helpful Resources&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://thinkgrowth.org/"&gt;ThinkGrowth.org: Stories, insights, &amp;amp; ideas to help you and your business grow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/science-backed-reasons-read"&gt;4 Science-Backed Reasons to Read More (Even If You're Busy)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/science-of-speed-reading#sm.0000e1w1nuwvbeo5sq61j1tim2kyj"&gt;The Science of Speed Reading: How Well Does It Actually Work?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;12) Move to the next level of your career.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Why?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"Next" can mean different things for different people -- changing your title, getting more responsibilities, gaining more authority in your industry, or starting your own business. Whatever it is, start now -- it could take longer than the next year to fully accomplish it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Don't let that scare you out of it, though. If you don't start moving forward now, it's easy to keep putting it off. Even if you're happy in your current professional situation, we've outlined many reasons in this post to continue learning, or at least add to your success with new goals and accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;How?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When it comes to big, life-changing moves, planning is fundamental. If your goal is really monstrous, try breaking it into a year-over-year plan, and using the first year's plan as the basis for your resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But if you're simply looking to grow and accomplish more, there are smaller steps that you can take this year. Jumping on opportunities to share your skills with others, for example, can enhance your career, especially if you do so through public speaking engagements. These aren't just beneficial for your audience -- they provide a great way to present yourself as an expert, increase your visibility both online and offline, and build your personal brand. Plus, getting your name out there in the context of your job is beneficial for your company, too.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Talk with your manager about opportunities your company can introduce, like local meet-ups or conferences. You could also get in touch with a university and offer a guest lecture -- after all, there's something very rewarding about inspiring future talent.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Helpful Resources&lt;/h4&gt;

        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Show Your Resolve&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There you have it. New Year's resolutions don't have to be quite so flighty, or involve gyms and special diets. They can help you become a better employee, and to continue learning and improving, no matter where you are in your career.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That said, do what works for you. We wouldn't expect anyone to try to tackle all 12 of these resolutions. Depending on where you are in life, some might be more feasible and practical than others. Think about your priorities, and choose from there.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From our team to yours, Happy New Year. We can't wait to hear about how you put these resolutions to work.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which of these resolutions will you make -- and actually stick to? What else would you add to the list? Let us know in the comments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;SEO is an evolving science. While some of the core principles will presumably stick around forever, some of the more nuanced parts of it are subject to continuous change. As a result, many of the "proven" tactics&amp;nbsp;people have&amp;nbsp;used in the past -- keyword stuffing, link schemes, and so on&amp;nbsp;-- are now the stuff of legends.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;SEO is an evolving science. While some of the core principles will presumably stick around forever, some of the more nuanced parts of it are subject to continuous change. As a result, many of the "proven" tactics&amp;nbsp;people have&amp;nbsp;used in the past -- keyword stuffing, link schemes, and so on&amp;nbsp;-- are now the stuff of legends.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Unless your organization benefits from having a dedicated SEO person who can work on this stuff day-in and day-out, keeping up with the latest changes in the world of SEO can be a struggle. But in the end, adjusting your strategy based on search ranking algorithm updates or changes in the way search results are displayed visually can be incredibly impactful on business results.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In our new guide, &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/seo-myths?utm_campaign=Offer%20-%2018%20SEO%20Myths%202017&amp;amp;utm_source=HS-blog"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18 SEO Myths to Leave Behind in 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we reiterate some of the best practices that should continue to guide your strategy through 2017, while also highlighting how SEO has changed over the course of 2016.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hereâ€™s an example of one those changes:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Did you know that Google had a major Penguin algorithm update in September 2016 that made the rewarding of high-quality websites in search results part of its core algorithm? What used to be a loose guideline turned&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;into a legitimate ranking rule in 2016. You can learn all about what that means inside the ebook.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/seo-myths?utm_campaign=Offer%20-%2018%20SEO%20Myths%202017&amp;amp;utm_source=HS-blog"&gt;Check out the &lt;em&gt;SEO Myths&lt;/em&gt; guide&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to learn more about what changes you'll need to make with&amp;nbsp;your SEO strategy moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The 10 Most Watched YouTube Ads of 2016 (And the Agencies Behind Them)</title>

        &lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/most-watched-youtube-ads-2016" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/most-watched-youtube-ads.png?t=1483790613555" alt="The 10 Most Watched YouTube Ads of 2016 (And the Agencies Behind Them)" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Most ads on YouTube are something to be endured, muted, and skipped immediately after the mandatory five&amp;nbsp;seconds has passed. It's nothing personal -- people just want to get to the good stuff.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So how can advertisers create branded videos that users actually want to watch?&lt;/p&gt;
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/most-watched-youtube-ads.png?t=1483790613555"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Most ads on YouTube are something to be endured, muted, and skipped immediately after the mandatory five&amp;nbsp;seconds has passed. It's nothing personal -- people just want to get to the good stuff.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So how can advertisers create branded videos that users actually want to watch?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For an ad to be sought out and consumed willingly on YouTube, it needs to&amp;nbsp;stand out as an enjoyable, compulsively shareable piece of content. It&amp;nbsp;can't just be a typical&amp;nbsp;advertisement -- it needs to compete for attention with viral, non-branded content.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To better understand what YouTube users want in a watchable online ad, let's take a look back at what worked in 2016. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/platforms/video/leaderboards/youtube-leaderboard-year-end-2016.html"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;a list of the top 10 most watched ads on YouTube from 2016, and we've compiled them here to inspire your next digital&amp;nbsp;ad campaign. All advertisers and marketers&amp;nbsp;should be taking notes: &lt;strong&gt;These are the online ads people actually &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to watch in 2016.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;The 10 Most Watched YouTube Ads of 2016&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1) Mobile Strike&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Things escalate quickly in this extended Super Bowl spot for &lt;a href="http://www.mobilestrikeapp.com/"&gt;Mobile Strike&lt;/a&gt;, an online multiplayer game. Starring former California governor and beloved action movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger, the plot follows Schwarzenegger as he's attacked by a slew of characters after opening up the Mobile Strike app on his phone.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A deadly fight for the phone ensues, and pretty soon there's a military tank crashing through the walls and marines rappelling from the ceilings.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Created by San Francisco-based &lt;a href="http://215mccann.com/"&gt;215mccann&lt;/a&gt;, the one-minute spot was the number one watched spot on YouTube in 2016, amassing &lt;strong&gt;over 102 million views&lt;/strong&gt; since its release in February.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
        &lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fF0ZmIf7H9k" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;2) Knorr&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://us.mullenlowe.com/"&gt;MullenLowe&lt;/a&gt; created this clever digital campaign for global&amp;nbsp;food and beverage brand &lt;a href="http://www.knorr.com/"&gt;Knorr&lt;/a&gt;. In the three-minute ad, a group of singles are paired off based on their favorite flavor profiles (e.g., spicy, hearty, salty etc.) and then asked to feed each other a meal matching the flavor preferences they share. The results are delightfully awkward.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It's a weird but undeniably touching social experiment, and Ukonwa Ojo, senior global director at Knorr, insists the emotions they captured on film were completely candid. "It's as real as I can humanly make it with cameras and equipment and people standing around," Ojo &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/unilever-brand-paired-people-same-taste-food-see-if-they-fell-love-171067"&gt;said to Adweek&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The ad has been &lt;strong&gt;watched over 60 million times&lt;/strong&gt; on YouTube since its release in April.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
        &lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xwx7NnPQ44U" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;3) Nike Football&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo experiences a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freaky_Friday_(2003_film)"&gt;Freaky Friday&lt;/a&gt; moment with a young fan in this short film from Nike and &lt;a href="http://www.wk.com/"&gt;Wieden + Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;. After taking a tumble into the crowd during a match, Ronaldo and a young British soccer fan switch bodies&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Naturally, the kid is in awe to find himself inhabiting the body of the famous footballer, but he quickly learns he'll have to improve his soccer skills if he's going to pass as Ronaldo. Meanwhile, the real Ronaldo -- trapped in the body of a teenager -- steadily rises through the ranks of youth football. Over the course of a year or so, he's made it to the pros.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Clocking in at nearly six minutes, it's Nike's longest brand film ever -- but it's definitely worth sticking around for the climactic ending. It's no surprise that it's picked up &lt;strong&gt;over&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;58 million views&lt;/strong&gt; on YouTube.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
        &lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/scWpXEYZEGk" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;4) Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Developed in-house at Samsung, this extended ad introduced consumers to the much-anticipated Galaxy S7 and S7 edge back in February.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The introduction video excels at condensing a lot of information into an easily digestible format, with sleek graphics and a dramatic soundtrack.&amp;nbsp; The video was watched &lt;strong&gt;over 46 million times.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
        &lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cyohHyQl-kc" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;5) Clash Royale&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Leave it to creative agency &lt;a href="http://bartonfgraf.com/"&gt;Barton F. Graf&lt;/a&gt; to produce something zany, offbeat, and yet somehow still universally appealing enough to get &lt;strong&gt;almost 38 million views&lt;/strong&gt; on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This ad for &lt;a href="https://clashroyale.com/"&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/a&gt;, a multiplayer mobile game, stars an turtleneck-clad keyboard player exuberantly explaining "the rules of the duel" -- in song, naturally. And not just any song. The whole ad is set to an altered version of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MS4_Z84-rRE"&gt;"Flash" by Queen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
        &lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xk_q3Zv_5w8" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;6) Mtn Dew Kickstart&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This ad raises more questions than it answers. What the &lt;i&gt;heck&lt;/i&gt; is that thing? How did it get into that apartment? What made those guys think following it outside would be a good idea?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Superbowl ad for &lt;a href="http://www.mountaindew.com/"&gt;Mtn Dew's energy beverage&lt;/a&gt;, produced by &lt;a href="https://bbdo.com/"&gt;BBDO&lt;/a&gt;, rapidly gained viral attention for it's visually unsettling main character: a Frankenstein creation with the head of an adorable pug, the torso of a monkey, and the legs of a human baby. It's not pretty to look at, but no one can deny that puppymonkeybaby accomplished what it set out to do: &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2016/02/08/why-puppymonkeybaby-was-the-best-commercial-of-super-bowl-2016/#498bc3637c3d"&gt;Get people talking&lt;/a&gt;. The ad received &lt;strong&gt;27 million hits&lt;/strong&gt; on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
        &lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ql7uY36-LwA" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;7) Always&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://always.com/en-us"&gt;Always&lt;/a&gt; worked with agency &lt;a href="http://leoburnett.com/"&gt;Leo Burnett&lt;/a&gt; to produce this ad focusing on female empowerment through sports. The ad, which ran during the summer Olympics, features a group of young women and girls explaining discouraging comments they've received about their athleticism, and encouraging all young girls to stick with sports no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The positive message propelled the ad to &lt;strong&gt;27 million views&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
        &lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Emawq64b0DU" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;8) Hyundai&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hyundaiusa.com/"&gt;Hyundai's&lt;/a&gt; Superbowl ad from agency &lt;a href="https://www.innoceanusa.com/"&gt;INNOCEAN USA&lt;/a&gt; opens on a couple racing through the woods -- with two vicious grizzly bears in close pursuit. Thanks to the voice activated technology on their Hyundai, they're able to make a speedy getaway.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The grizzly bears, discouraged by their prey's escape, plop down for an unexpectedly cartoonish conversation. "I was just gonna hug him!" one of them says. It's an amusing example of thwarted expectations that drew in &lt;strong&gt;26 million YouTube viewers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
        &lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LT6n1HcJOio" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;9) PokÃ©mon&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This Superbowl ad from Los Angeles-based agency &lt;a href="http://www.omeletla.com/"&gt;Omelet&lt;/a&gt; celebrates 20 years of &lt;a href="http://www.pokemon.com/us/"&gt;PokÃ©mon&lt;/a&gt; with cinematic flair.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taking cues from sports advertising, the commercial follows a series of kids and young adults as they train in their respective fields, drawing inspiration from each others' successes. In the final scene, a young boy witnesses an epic PokÃ©mon battle on TV, and his dad declares, "You could do that." The ad received &lt;strong&gt;25 million views on YouTube&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
        &lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2F46tGehnfo" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;10) Skittles&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skittles.com/"&gt;Skittles&lt;/a&gt; is no stranger to delightfully weird advertising, and their Superbowl commercial this year was no exception. In the &lt;a href="https://www.ddb.com/offices/north-america/usa/ddb-chicago/"&gt;DDB Chicago&lt;/a&gt;-produced spot, Aerosmith rocker Steven Tyler is presented with a portrait of his likeness made entirely from Skittles. And it sings, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24 million people&lt;/strong&gt; tuned in to see the ad.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
        &lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/21ivbtgqJkg" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

      <title>The Introvert's Guide to Running a Meeting</title>

        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/introverts-guide-to-running-meetings" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/IntrovertThoughts-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="The Introvert's Guide to Running a Meeting" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What do you think of when you see the word "introvert"?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"Shy," "quiet," and even "antisocial" might be some qualities that come to mind. But we've got news for you: How we think of introverts is pretty misconstrued from the actual definition. An introvert, according to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/introvert"&gt;Dictionary.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is "a person characterized by concern primarily with his or her own thoughts and feelings." Let's explore that.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IntrovertThoughts-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=761&amp;amp;name=IntrovertThoughts-compressor.jpg" alt="IntrovertThoughts-compressor.jpg" width="761" title="IntrovertThoughts-compressor.jpg" style="width: 761px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What do you think of when you see the word "introvert"?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"Shy," "quiet," and even "antisocial" might be some qualities that come to mind. But we've got news for you: How we think of introverts is pretty misconstrued from the actual definition. An introvert, according to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/introvert"&gt;Dictionary.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is "a person characterized by concern primarily with his or her own thoughts and feelings." Let's explore that.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Looking at that definition, introverts aren't necessarily the timid lambs that stereotypes make them out to be. Rather, they're introspective individuals who can still be outgoing -- they just don't crave being around other people, speaking and presenting, all the time.&lt;a class="cta_button" href="https://offers.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=2f88f62a-59e8-4cc6-be0f-23d432a268d5&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid="&gt; &lt;img class="hs-cta-img " style="border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; " alt="Download our leadership guide for actionable advice &amp;amp; guidelines from  HubSpot's Dharmesh Shah.&amp;nbsp;" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/2f88f62a-59e8-4cc6-be0f-23d432a268d5.png"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That's why it might be a bit trickier for introverts to run a meeting -- not because they're reticent, but because they take &lt;a href="http://www.quietrev.com/6-illustrations-that-show-what-its-like-in-an-introverts-head/"&gt;extra time to process their internal thoughts and surroundings&lt;/a&gt;, according to Quiet Revolution, an organization dedicated to the science of psychological introversion.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But "tricky" certainly doesn't translate to "impossible." So if you're an introvert who's been charged with running a meeting, check out these tips.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;But First, a Little More on Introversion&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ll never forget the day I found out that I might be an introvert. I came across an article that described the characteristics of introverts, and realized that they matched many of my social patterns -- things like &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts/transcript?language=en#t-255930"&gt;enjoying quiet time to myself&lt;/a&gt;, or in a social situation, &lt;a href="http://qli.quietrev.com/how-to-network-like-an-introvert/"&gt;opting for longer conversations with fewer people&lt;/a&gt; (rather than small talk with tons of strangers).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But how could &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; be an introvert? I was a theatre minor. I used to sing with a punk band. Those were not things that introverts do, right?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Wrong. The more research I do on introversion, the more I realize that itâ€™s a vastly misunderstood population. And itâ€™s a big population. According to the Quiet Leadership Institute (an extension of Quiet Revolution), &lt;a href="http://qli.quietrev.com/"&gt;half of the U.S. workforce identifies as introverts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Susan Cain, co-founder of Quiet Revolution, explored these misconceptions in her 2012 &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts/transcript?language=en#t-176101"&gt;TED talk&lt;/a&gt;. I, like many others, had introversion confused with shyness, or maybe even stage fright -- neither of which Iâ€™ve ever possessed. But introversion, she explained, is â€œdifferent from being shy. Shyness is about fear of social judgment. &lt;strong&gt;Introversion is more about, how do you respond to stimulation, including social stimulation.&lt;/strong&gt;â€&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thatâ€™s what makes us different from extroverts, who â€œcrave large amounts of stimulation,â€ noted Cain. Itâ€™s not that introverts are &lt;i&gt;afraid&lt;/i&gt; to lead meetings -- or speak in public, sing with a punk band, or go to parties alone. The distinction is how we prepare for or function in those situations.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when it comes to introverts and extroverts, &lt;strong&gt;one isn't better than the other. &lt;/strong&gt;Plus, according to Cain, the "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH7V1jiG6Dk"&gt;best performing teams are a mix [of] introverts and extroverts.&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So when it comes to those meetings, here are our tips for how introverts can run them in an effective way.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;The Introvert's Guide to Running a Meeting&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1) Know where you stand.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;First things first: You might not even be sure where you stand on the introvert/extrovert spectrum. Guess what -- Quiet Revolution has a &lt;a href="http://www.quietrev.com/the-introvert-test/"&gt;quiz&lt;/a&gt; for that.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this post, the assessment is probably most helpful for folks who donâ€™t think -- or donâ€™t want to accept -- that theyâ€™re introverts. But a quiz like this one can help you learn a lot about your behavioral patterns, and perhaps avoid a case of mistaken identity.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202016-12-01%20at%202.57.34%20PM.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202016-12-01%20at%202.57.34%20PM.png" alt="Introversion Extroversion Quiz" width="669" title="Introversion Extroversion Quiz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href="http://www.quietrev.com/the-introvert-test/"&gt;Quiet Revolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For example, according to the Quiet Leadership Institute, &lt;a href="http://qli.quietrev.com/"&gt;96% of workforce leaders identify as extroverts&lt;/a&gt;. That implies a staggering imbalance among management, but could that number be the result of personal misconceptions similar to my own? Perhaps these leaders identify as such because they enjoy taking charge and overseeing groups. As we covered, introverts can still possess those qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You might even be an &lt;a href="http://www.quietrev.com/ambivert-results/"&gt;ambivert&lt;/a&gt; -- someone who falls in the middle of the spectrum -- which after taking the quiz, I learned is the bucket into which I fall. In any case, having this information can help you recognize certain habits, which in turn can help you lead more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;2) Set aside (quiet) time to form an agenda.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When I asked my team for meeting leadership tips, my colleague, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/janessalantz"&gt;Janessa Lantz&lt;/a&gt;, made an excellent point.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;â€œIntroverts often need time to prepare thoughts,â€ she told me. â€œBy sending out an agenda in advance, youâ€™re designing a more inclusive meeting.â€&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But planning a meeting this way doesnâ€™t just benefit the attendees -- as considerate at that might be -- it also works to your advantage. &lt;a href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/the-introspective-personality"&gt;Nearly 86% of people with introverted qualities agree that they â€œpay a lot of attention to the meaning of [their] thoughts and actions&lt;/a&gt;.â€ And while that can lead to a more thoughtful approach to things, it also requires extra time.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thatâ€™s where being the designated leader of a meeting is a good thing. You have the luxury of time to yourself, hopefully, to plan the meeting and put the necessary consideration into it. So donâ€™t look at the task as a setback -- itâ€™s actually an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;3) Lead with the topics you're passionate about.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Many introverted leaders admit that while social interaction doesnâ€™t frighten them, prolonged exposure to it can leave them feeling less energized, &lt;a href="http://www.quietrev.com/5-myths-about-introverts-and-extroverts/"&gt;due to their sensitivities to stimulation&lt;/a&gt;. Thatâ€™s why, during a panel discussion on introversion at the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH7V1jiG6Dk"&gt;2016 New Work Summit&lt;/a&gt;, LinkedIn Chief Human Resources Officer -- and self-proclaimed introvert -- Pat Wadors recommended starting the meeting off with topics youâ€™re most passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"If there's passion around a topic, I don't want to be in my head worried about, 'Will I be called on?â€™â€ Wadors explained. â€œI have a point of view. I will speak early. And then, my energy is spent really actively listening and being present." Check out the full discussion:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-youtube"&gt;
        &lt;iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XH7V1jiG6Dk" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hereâ€™s another opportunity for you to use running a meeting to your advantage. If thereâ€™s something that you strongly feel needs to be discussed, consider proactively scheduling a meeting that will be entirely dedicated to it. That allows you to dedicate extra time to a specific topic or project thatâ€™s important to you, and thoughtfully form an agenda with points that are vital to it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But scheduling meetings comes with its own set of parameters, which brings us to our next point.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;4) Invite only those who absolutely need to be present.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As we noted earlier, introverts tend to value quality over quantity in social situations. Meetings are no different. Instead of inviting the entire team, only invite the people who absolutely need to be there, and focus on having a productive conversation with them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That technique goes beyond introversion -- after all, thereâ€™s a book out there called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cameronherold.com/blog/meetings/meetings-suck/"&gt;Meetings Suck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for a reason. Theyâ€™re a huge culprit when it comes to wasting time. Just look at these statistics from the &lt;a href="https://cdn.wrike.com/ebook/Wrike-Work-Management-Report-2015.pdf"&gt;Wrike Work Management Survey&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;24% of employees cite meetings as their biggest productivity roadblock.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;34% say that they attend six or more meetings per week.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Only 9% of meeting attendees believe they always walk away with clear, actionable outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When youâ€™re tasked with running a meeting, make sure itâ€™s done efficiently, and help conserve the time of others wherever you can. Since introverts tend to thrive in situations that permit a higher-quality discussion with a fewer number of people, this approach should help make the meeting more productive and thoughtful.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;5) Take your time during the meeting.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the article â€œ&lt;a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/274655"&gt;An Introvert's Guide to Communicating With Results&lt;/a&gt;,â€ entrepreneur and CEO Caren Merrick writes, â€œIt is perfectly acceptable to not immediately answer a question.â€&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As long as weâ€™re being honest, Iâ€™ll confess that I sometimes have a bad habit of speaking up in meetings or discussions, just for the sake of looking like Iâ€™m engaged. Trust me -- Donâ€™t do that.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As per Merrickâ€™s advice, itâ€™s better to take your time to contribute something thoughtful to a conversation, even if you do so after the fact in a follow-up email or chat. In fact, you can even build that into your agenda, by dedicating a portion of the meeting to outlining next steps and â€œquestions to be answered.â€ Then, make sure you schedule time for yourself to personally debrief what you took away from the meeting, and any further commentary youâ€™d like to provide afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That said, donâ€™t take too long to follow up. With our growing &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/organize-to-do-list"&gt;to-do lists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/03/12/humans-have-shorter-attention-span-than-goldfish-thanks-to-smart/"&gt;shrinking attention spans&lt;/a&gt;, youâ€™ll want to make sure the meeting is still somewhat fresh in your colleaguesâ€™ minds when they receive your notes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;6) Schedule time to decompress after the meeting.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In addition to setting aside post-meeting time to debrief, you might want to clear your schedule for time to decompress. Because of an introvertâ€™s aforementioned sensitivity to stimulation, itâ€™s often helpful to schedule a meeting and organize your day around it so that low-energy tasks follow it, or a re-charging activity, like having a quiet lunch break.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Permitting yourself that time to refuel -- even if itâ€™s the rest of the work day -- will allow you to revisit items from your meeting when youâ€™re clear-minded and energized. Chances are, your colleagues would prefer that your follow-up communication is thought-out, rather than immediate.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Youâ€™ve Got This&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now that you know what it &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; means to be an introvert, you might feel a little bit more empowered. With this information, not only can you go forward with a renewed sense of confidence, but also, you have a greater understanding of what helps you to be a strong leader.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And again -- Maybe youâ€™re not actually an introvert, or youâ€™re a mix of both. Wherever you fall on the spectrum, itâ€™s important to understand what allows you to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Understanding these work styles wonâ€™t just give you introspective insights -- it can also make you a better leader with a greater comprehension of whatâ€™s best for your colleagues. As you plan and run these meetings, do so with your team in mind, and see how these approaches fit into the way they work.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So go ahead, do a little research. Next time youâ€™re asked to run a meeting, youâ€™ll be glad you did.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What helps you lead a meeting -- especially as an introvert? Let us know in the comments.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving the Performance of Your PPC Campaigns: Little-Known Tips to Try [Infographic]</title>

        &lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc-campaign-tips" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/PPC-Gifographic-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="Improving the Performance of Your PPC Campaigns: Little-Known Tips to Try [Infographic]" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Let's say youâ€™re climbing the performance chart that reflects your ad campaigns. After all that hard work and PPC strategizing you put toward improving your performance grade, how steep is the climb looking? Is it an &lt;i&gt;easy&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;tough&lt;/i&gt; climb?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some of us come off as natural all-star rock climbers, while others are left frigid, timid, and stuck to the crevices of the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/PPC-Gifographic-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;height=302&amp;amp;name=PPC-Gifographic-compressor.jpg" alt="PPC-Gifographic-compressor.jpg" width="730" height="302"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Let's say youâ€™re climbing the performance chart that reflects your ad campaigns. After all that hard work and PPC strategizing you put toward improving your performance grade, how steep is the climb looking? Is it an &lt;i&gt;easy&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;tough&lt;/i&gt; climb?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some of us come off as natural all-star rock climbers, while others are left frigid, timid, and stuck to the crevices of the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whatâ€™s the secret? As with most things: proper training. And if you don't have any, don't worry -- there's still hope.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We here at &lt;a href="http://klientboost.com"&gt;KlientBoost&lt;/a&gt; have partnered up with HubSpot to bring you some rock solid tactics that you can use to get a grip on the whole PPC thing.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/25-HubSpot-PPC-Tactics.gif?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=25-HubSpot-PPC-Tactics.gif" alt="25-HubSpot-PPC-Tactics.gif" width="669" title="25-HubSpot-PPC-Tactics.gif" style="width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;The Iceberg Effect: Gain More Control Over Your PPC Campaign&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The search terms that you end up paying for and the keywords that youâ€™re actually targeting donâ€™t always line up the way you want.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Too often we see the "&lt;a href="https://klientboost.com/ppc/adwords-strategy/"&gt;Iceberg Effect&lt;/a&gt;" in action, where miscellaneous search terms below the surface are tacked onto keywords that we think are working properly in our ad campaigns. It gives us an unhealthy search to keyword ratio that might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Iceberg%20Effect.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;name=Iceberg%20Effect.png" alt="Iceberg Effect.png" width="600" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 600px;" title="Iceberg Effect.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not being in control of all those search terms? Not ideal. With a search term to keyword discrepancy ratio of 132:1, it can be challenging to continually improve your clickthrough rates and lower your cost-per-click averages.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;How do you gain control of this icy situation? We use something called &lt;a href="https://klientboost.com/ppc/single-keyword-ad-groups/"&gt;Single Keyword Ad Groups (SKAGs)&lt;/a&gt; to shoot for a 1:1 ratio of search terms to keywords, allowing for more control over the entire ad group.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hereâ€™s what a non-SKAGs search term report might look like:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/adwords-help-600x348.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=348&amp;amp;name=adwords-help-600x348.png" alt="adwords-help-600x348.png" width="600" height="348" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s not that any of these search terms are bad, itâ€™s that each search term has a different conversion and sales rate. And by keeping them as search terms and not turning them into keywords, you will never be able to control them to take your PPC campaigns to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So what does a search term report look like if we use this granular PPC tactic and use SKAGs?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/improve-ppc-campaigns-600x337.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=337&amp;amp;name=improve-ppc-campaigns-600x337.png" alt="improve-ppc-campaigns-600x337.png" width="600" height="337" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Everything in the search term column matches the keyword column. With the SKAGs tactic, you can get super granular and isolate one variable at a time, which means you have more control over your entire PPC account.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And with the ability to lower your search term to keyword ratio to 1:1, you can take it one step further and do the same from keyword to ad. When this happens, youâ€™re able to increase your clickthrough rate, which in turn:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Increases your quality score&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Decreases your cost-per-click&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Increases your impression share&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Improves your average position&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Value Tracking: Keeping Tabs on Conversions vs. Sales&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With your PPC tactics now upgraded, your PPC campaigns should be driving up conversion volumes and making you more money. But do you know which keywords, audiences, or placements are actually making you money?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you donâ€™t track the components of your campaign and attribute them to your sales, you might be missing out on where to focus your efforts. By implementing Googleâ€™s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2375447?hl=en"&gt;ValueTrack parameters&lt;/a&gt; you can automatically track data within URLs when your visitors convert.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you tie your hidden field sales tracking back to your CRM, you can find out specific details about which leads are making you the revenue (doesnâ€™t apply to ecommerce). Hidden form fields can reveal to you things that happen during a conversion, like which landing page URL your conversion came from, where the visitor is located, or what keyword they typed in.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You can also do this with manual &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht"&gt;UTM parameters&lt;/a&gt;. Hereâ€™s an example of how on the surface, you would think Keyword #1 is converting better:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Top%20Performing%20Keyword.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=598&amp;amp;height=335&amp;amp;name=Top%20Performing%20Keyword.png" alt="Top Performing Keyword.png" width="598" height="335" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px;"&gt;Keyword #1 has a lower cost-per-conversion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hereâ€™s an example of what hidden field sales tracking can reveal to you on a deeper level:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/PPC%20Keyword%20Insights%20.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=594&amp;amp;height=334&amp;amp;name=PPC%20Keyword%20Insights%20.png" alt="PPC Keyword Insights .png" width="594" height="334" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px;"&gt;Now Keyword #2 looks better, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Although Keyword #1 has a lower cost-per-conversion, Keyword #2 has a much higher sales rate, which is making you more money. See the benefits of tracking the sale vs. the conversion?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Knowing these types of details can help you understand where you should be crediting your sales success, so you can be more aggressive in bidding on those keywords, audiences, or placements. With this PPC tactic, you can ease up your budget on the areas that arenâ€™t contributing to sales, and allocate to the areas that are.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;The CTA Thermometer: Gauging Visitor Intent on the Temperature Scale&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not all PPC visitors come through to your landing pages with the same conversion intent.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Typically, those that come through from display tend to be colder, while visitors that come in from search tend to be warmer. Hereâ€™s a visual weâ€™ve learned works well across the multitude of client verticals we service:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202016-12-19%20at%2011.17.23%20AM.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=615&amp;amp;height=316&amp;amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202016-12-19%20at%2011.17.23%20AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-12-19 at 11.17.23 AM.png" width="615" height="316" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thereâ€™s a temperature scale that varies depending on visitor origin. Knowing where your visitors come from can help you immensely when it comes to matching your call-to-action with their temperature in the conversion funnel.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We recommend testing out various CTAs to match the intent temperature of your visitors -- after all, a small CTA tweak couldâ€™ve made all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here are some ideas to make your offer more relevant to your visitors:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202016-12-19%20at%2011.19.35%20AM.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=611&amp;amp;height=336&amp;amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202016-12-19%20at%2011.19.35%20AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-12-19 at 11.19.35 AM.png" width="611" height="336" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;In short: the warmer your visitorâ€™s intent the warmer the CTA can be. Traffic that comes in from the display network will likely respond to colder CTAs, since those visitors are in the awareness stage.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Micro PPC Conversions: Breaking Down the Larger Conversion Into Smaller Pieces&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As you know, the more granular and detail-oriented you can get with you PPC campaigns, the more control you can have over the success of them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When it comes to conversions, you can break down your larger macro conversion into micro conversions to figure out where your issues are.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An effective way to figure out which part of your PPC campaign is causing the conversion bottleneck is to analyze the micro conversions. Letâ€™s say that youâ€™re running some new Facebook campaigns but for some reason, no one is converting. If you knew, however, that visitors spend an average of four seconds on your site/landing page, then you know that your Facebook ad targeting may be off. Instead of thinking itâ€™s the ad or landing page that needs some tweaking, it could be your targeting instead.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here are some common types of micro conversions we use to analyze the path towards a conversion:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/micro%20conversions.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=596&amp;amp;height=317&amp;amp;name=micro%20conversions.png" alt="micro conversions.png" width="596" height="317" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What can each of these common micro conversions tell you about your landing page? Letâ€™s break it down:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time On Site. &lt;/strong&gt;How long are your visitors spending on your site? If the time is brief, the conversion issue doesnâ€™t have to do with your landing page design. The issue is happening in an earlier stage, like in your ad campaign or your targeting options.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scroll Depth.&lt;/strong&gt; How far are your visitors scrolling down your landing page? If they arenâ€™t scrolling down very far, maybe you need to have a shorter landing page where your CTA is above the fold. If theyâ€™re scrolling pretty deep, it might be a good opportunity to include additional (super legible) offer details toward the bottom of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form Field Completion. &lt;/strong&gt;Are visitors abandoning your forms? If so, try testing out different formats and include a multi-step landing page with more form fields.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Button Click. &lt;/strong&gt;Testing out different CTA button colors and copy may be the key to your larger conversion success.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By isolating micro conversions you can zero in on where exactly the conversion friction is located, which can help you alleviate the issues quickly and reach your larger conversion goal.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whether itâ€™s addressing the Iceberg Effect, tracking your sales vs. conversions, testing CTA temperatures, or analyzing your micro PPC conversions, each of these PPC tactics can have a significantly positive impact on the performance of your campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And the best part, thereâ€™s a good chance your competitors donâ€™t even know about them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now itâ€™s your turn to up your PPC performance game. With these useful PPC tactics, youâ€™ll be climbing your performance incline to the top with utmost ease.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are your best PPC tips? Share them in the comments below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With the recent release of Google Home in the U.S., voice-activated devices are a big topic du jour lately. But which personal assistant tools are the most helpful? What do you need for each one? And how much do they cost?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While a simple search for â€œ&lt;a href="https://goo.gl/Bg4vTR"&gt;personal assistant apps&lt;/a&gt;â€ seems to yield countless results, shifting through them can be a task.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/PersonalAssistantTools-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=761&amp;amp;name=PersonalAssistantTools-compressor.jpg" alt="PersonalAssistantTools-compressor.jpg" width="761" title="PersonalAssistantTools-compressor.jpg" style="width: 761px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With the recent release of Google Home in the U.S., voice-activated devices are a big topic du jour lately. But which personal assistant tools are the most helpful? What do you need for each one? And how much do they cost?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While a simple search for â€œ&lt;a href="https://goo.gl/Bg4vTR"&gt;personal assistant apps&lt;/a&gt;â€ seems to yield countless results, shifting through them can be a task.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Today, consider us your digital personal assistant. We narrowed the options down to our very own top five. Read on, and discover which ones will best fit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;5 Personal Assistant Tools That Actually Make Life Easier&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1) &lt;a href="https://www.operator.com/"&gt;Operator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Free&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; iOS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Vacations are great. Holiday parties are, too. But scheduling the former immediately after the latter? Well, itâ€™s a prescription for stress. There are people to feed, wines to buy, and bags to pack.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But wait. Thereâ€™s an app for that. With a packed work schedule, who has the time to deal with the aforementioned items, let alone to find special decorative lights? The experts at Operator -- thatâ€™s who.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once you download Operator, youâ€™ll see a blue dialogue bubble in the lower right corner of your screen. Tap that, then choose where you need help.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Operator_Start.gif?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;name=Operator_Start.gif" alt="Operator_Start.gif" width="400" title="Operator_Start.gif" style="width: 400px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From there, youâ€™ll be asked a series of questions about what exactly you need. Hereâ€™s a chat that I had with a real person -- Holly -- when I needed help finding some decorative lights for that party.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Operator_HanukkahLights.gif?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;name=Operator_HanukkahLights.gif" alt="Operator_HanukkahLights.gif" width="400" title="Operator_HanukkahLights.gif" style="width: 400px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Holly later went on to ask me about my price range, shipping preferences, and sent me several lighting options. And look, she even laughed at my joke.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;2) &lt;a href="https://charlieapp.com/"&gt;Charlie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt; Free&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt; Google Calendar, iOS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Knowing your audience is something on which we place great importance. Thatâ€™s why we do things like &lt;a href="http://www.makemypersona.com/"&gt;create buyer personas&lt;/a&gt; and perform other user research.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thatâ€™s important in marketing -- and in meetings. After all, if an important contact with whom youâ€™re not completely familiar agrees to meet with you, itâ€™s best to avoid walking in without any knowledge of what the person does. Thatâ€™s where Charlie comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Charlie connects to your calendar to see who you have meetings with over the next week. Then, it identifies the person and asks if youâ€™d like some background information on them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s not as creepy as it sounds, though. The only information it finds is whatâ€™s publicly available online, like on LinkedIn and Twitter. For example, hereâ€™s what it would look like if someone had a meeting with me:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/AZW_Charlie.gif?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;name=AZW_Charlie.gif" alt="AZW_Charlie.gif" width="400" title="AZW_Charlie.gif" style="width: 400px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Notice that thereâ€™s a section on â€œways to start the conversation.â€ That contains news pieces about the person that can help you open a dialogue with the person. Plus, in case youâ€™ve been in touch with this contact before, Charlie allows you to review any previous communication youâ€™ve had with him or her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;3) &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_home?utm_source=madeByGoogle&amp;amp;utm_medium=MS&amp;amp;utm_campaign=google_home_BN"&gt;Google Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;i&gt;Allo (free), Google Home ($129)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Android 4.1 and higher, iOS 8 and higher (only available in English and for purchase in the U.S.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When I asked my team for personal assistant app recommendations, HubSpotâ€™s Web Team Tech Lead, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitryshamis"&gt;Dmitry Shamis&lt;/a&gt;, immediately pointed to Google Home.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What does he love about it? Well, it does the same thing that a lot of similar devices on the market do -- things like responding to hands-free voice prompts, for example -- but it also incorporates many elements of Google that many we use day-to-day, including search.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;â€œThe real benefit is how it integrates into my Google life,â€ Shamis told me. â€œMy trips, my calendar, my shopping list.â€&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Google Home is less of an app, however, and more of a device. Itâ€™s powered by Google Assistant -- the technology used to answer questions in the search engineâ€™s Allo app, which is configured to respond to search queries, set reminders, and engage in everyday chit chat. Have a look:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Assistant.gif?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;name=Google%20Assistant.gif" alt="Google Assistant.gif" width="400" title="Google Assistant.gif" style="width: 400px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Imagine if I could have that entire conversation without all the typing. Sure, the Assistant technology alone is great, but the whole hands-free help thing offered by Google Home? That's just awesome. I mean, just look at its list of &lt;a href="https://madeby.google.com/home/features/#?filters=entertainment,answers,manage,plan,home,fun"&gt;features&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;4) &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-WiFi-Alexa/dp/B00X4WHP5E"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt; $179 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt; Wi-Fi. Compatible with Fire OS, Android, and iOS devices and accessible via web browser.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before there was Google Home, there was Amazon Echo -- which Shamis tells me is what he used first. The Echo is powered by Alexa, Amazonâ€™s voice recognition technology, which is used less for search engine capabilities, and more for instant information like sports scores, weather, and news.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Despite his happiness with Google Home, there are still some things about the Amazon Echo that Shamis misses. Heâ€™s particularly nostalgic, he told me, for the ability to quickly buy things with the Echo. For example, he told me, â€œThings like, â€˜Alexa, buy more dog foodâ€™ were extremely helpful.â€&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And another key differentiator for him? Echoâ€™s Spotify integration. "â€˜Alexa, play Spotifyâ€™ would pick up where I left off on my phone,â€ he explained. â€œâ€˜Hey Google, play Spotifyâ€™ will play something completely random.â€&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when I asked Shamis if heâ€™d advise someone to get both, his answer was a resounding â€œno.â€&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;â€œItâ€™s one or the other,â€ he said, since â€œthereâ€™s enough overlap that you donâ€™t need both. I think it becomes a personal preference.â€&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thatâ€™s not to say itâ€™s impossible to use both, especially for oneâ€™s personal entertainment -- like in this video of the two devices speaking to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-youtube"&gt;
        &lt;iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZfCfTYZJWtI" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;5) &lt;a href="https://www.juliedesk.com"&gt;Julie Desk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt; Pro ($99.99 month/per user), Manager ($149.99 month/per user), Executive ($199.99 month/per user)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt; Any email client&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Visit the official website for Julie Desk, and youâ€™ll be faced with a question: â€œWant to get back 1 hour in your work day?â€&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Um, yes. Thatâ€™s what Julie Desk was created to do -- to save us the countless time we spent on managing our respective calendars. And admittedly, for me, thatâ€™s a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But starting with that question, Julie Deskâ€™s website is a compelling example of great user experience -- which hints at its capacity to work on behalf of, well, you, the user. Have a look:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/JulieDesk.gif?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=JulieDesk.gif" alt="JulieDesk.gif" width="669" title="JulieDesk.gif" style="width: 669px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are are few things about Julie Desk that delight us. To start, there are no downloads required, since Julie -- as sheâ€™s casually called -- works with your existing email client.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you first sign up for the service, youâ€™ll be asked for your meeting preferences, like time of day, location, and mode of transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It takes about 24 hours for Julie to get you completely enrolled in the service, probably because thereâ€™s a human element -- the service is constantly monitored by actual people to make sure nothing goes awry. But once youâ€™re set up, thatâ€™s when the fun begins. Every time you receive an email requesting a meeting, just copy Julie on your reply -- sheâ€™ll take it from there.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hereâ€™s more on how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-youtube"&gt;
        &lt;iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9DOx967ZLDY" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Appy, Healthy, More Productive&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From online human interaction, to digital voice recognition, to a virtual meeting scheduler, these apps might not cover everything, but they certainly make life easier.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sure, it would be nice if there was a tool out there to, say, virtually clean the entire house. Until that becomes available, weâ€™re not entirely far off. And some of these resources could at least provide information on home-cleaning-made-easy hacks -- but only if you ask.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Remember when any of these tools seemed like â€œa thing of the futureâ€? Theyâ€™re here -- and we canâ€™t wait to see whatâ€™s next.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blogging for SEO: How to Write Blogs that Rank on Page One</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogging-for-seo</link>
      <description>
        &lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogging-for-seo" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/ThinkstockPhotos-493335634-608582-edited.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="ThinkstockPhotos-493335634-608582-edited.jpg" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Did you know that the search result in #1 position on Google gets &lt;a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/study/2276184/no-1-position-in-google-gets-33-of-search-traffic-study"&gt;33% of search traffic&lt;/a&gt;? And that page 1 search engine results resulted in 92% of all traffic, dropping off by 95% for page 2?&lt;/p&gt;
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ThinkstockPhotos-493335634-608582-edited.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;height=302&amp;amp;name=ThinkstockPhotos-493335634-608582-edited.jpg" alt="ThinkstockPhotos-493335634-608582-edited.jpg" width="730" height="302"&gt;Did you know that the search result in #1 position on Google gets &lt;a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/study/2276184/no-1-position-in-google-gets-33-of-search-traffic-study"&gt;33% of search traffic&lt;/a&gt;? And that page 1 search engine results resulted in 92% of all traffic, dropping off by 95% for page 2?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Numbers donâ€™t lie. If you want to climb to the top of search engine results pages (SERPs), well-written, engaging content alone wonâ€™t cut it. You also need to focus on writing SEO-driven, keyword-focused content that attracts not only website traffic, but the right kind of traffic. You might be thinking, â€œThat sounds great, Courtney! But, how do I get started?â€&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Weâ€™re sharing 5 essential tips for creating SEO-friendly blog posts without sacrificing &lt;a href="http://experience.stratusinteractive.com/blog/does-your-website-user-experience-ruin-or-help-your-brand"&gt;user experience&lt;/a&gt; and engagement, tips you can start using today:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;1) Pick highly-effective keywords&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Google handles &lt;a href="http://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/"&gt;over 40,000 search queries&lt;/a&gt; a second. Staggering, right? If you want to cut through search result clutter and outrank your competitors, you need to target the specific keywords and phrases your potential customers are searching. How else will they find your content and website?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To identify those hot keywords, head on over to the social platforms your target audience frequents and see whatâ€™s trending. Pay close attention to the exact phrases they use and monitor popular industry terms and topics.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/trends/"&gt;Google Trends&lt;/a&gt; can also give you a feel for what keywords are popular at any given time. If you see searches are steadily declining over time for a specific keyword, you know thatâ€™s probably not the right keyword to target for your marketing and vice versa for increasing trends.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If youâ€™re ever running low on keyword ideas, get inspiration from your competition. Use tools to see what keywords theyâ€™re currently ranking for â€” if these keywords are relevant to your business, consider using them too! &lt;a href="https://www.semrush.com/"&gt;SEMRush&lt;/a&gt; lets you enter a competitor and see the keywords theyâ€™re ranking for, their position in search results, traffic received for that keyword and other key metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the most obvious keywords arenâ€™t always the best keywords. Searchers tend to use very specific â€œlong-tailâ€ keywords, keyword phrases and questions when theyâ€™re looking for something. Long-tail keywords comprise up to &lt;a href="https://www.hittail.com/blog/the-hidden-value-of-long-tail-seo"&gt;70% of all search traffic&lt;/a&gt; and can unlock the door to successful SEO. When &lt;a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/"&gt;WPBeginner&lt;/a&gt;, the largest WordPress resource site for WordPress beginners, adopted a long-tail SEO strategy, they increased their organic search traffic by &lt;a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-we-increased-our-organic-search-traffic-by-using-hittail/"&gt;20% in just two months&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Because you face fierce competition for shorter, more general keywords, you often have a better chance of ranking in the top results for long-tail keywords. And, long-tail keywords allow you to zero in on higher quality website traffic that often knows what theyâ€™re looking for and may be farther along in the buyerâ€™s journey.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once youâ€™ve done your research and built a list of what you think are the most valuable, relevant keywords, plug them into a keyword research tool like Googleâ€™s &lt;a href="https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner"&gt;Keyword Planner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://moz.com/products/pro/keyword-explorer"&gt;Mozâ€™s Keyword Explorer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://keywordseverywhere.com/ubersuggest.html"&gt;Ubersuggest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://keywordtool.io/"&gt;Keyword Tool&lt;/a&gt; and so on. Many keyword research tools give you the monthly volume for any given keyword. Test out different keyword tools â€” marketers are drawn to different ones for different reasons. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Depending on your business or industry (or budget or bandwidth for SEO efforts), it may be important to rank for high competition, short tail keywords. Still, try to also optimize for a healthy dose of long-tail keywords that are high in search volume but low in competition. You may find itâ€™s much easier to rank for these words.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Remember that your focus keywords will evolve over time as trends shift, terminology changes or your product/service line changes. Be sure to conduct keyword research periodically to ensure youâ€™re still focusing on the right keywords for your target audience and not missing out on vital ranking opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;2) Naturally integrate keywords throughout your posts&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once youâ€™ve decided on a list of target keywords, itâ€™s time to write a blog post focused on one of these keywords. Brainstorm blog topics with your team and decide on a topic that will entice and engage your target audience.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Keep your &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/Everything-Marketers-Need-to-Research-Create-Detailed-Buyer-Personas-Template.aspx"&gt;buyer personas&lt;/a&gt;, their motivations, challenges, interests, etc. in mind throughout the brainstorming process. Choose a topic that will &lt;a href="http://experience.stratusinteractive.com/blog/how-to-create-an-emotional-connection-with-prospects-to-turn-them-into-customers"&gt;emotionally resonate&lt;/a&gt; with your potential customers and their needs, desires or pains.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As you write your blog, your keyword and natural variations should be regularly interspersed throughout the post. Your primary keyword should appear in these key places:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Title&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Headings and subheadings&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;URL if possible&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Image alt text (search engines canâ€™t read images)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Meta description&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Throughout the content&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Remember that youâ€™re writing for humans, not search engines. Focus on engaging readers with a natural writing style that takes their needs and interests into account.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Be sure to avoid overusing any keyword (also known as â€œkeyword stuffingâ€) at all costs. Keyword stuffing may lead to a website being penalized or banned in search engine results pages either temporarily or permanently. But even more importantly, if your keyword appears too often and feels forced, you sacrifice a readerâ€™s experience, insult their intelligence and compromise the articleâ€™s quality. Donâ€™t give readers any reason to hit the back button and turn to a competitorâ€™s blog for answers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;3) Link to influencers&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As you build out your blog post, donâ€™t be afraid to link to other articles or blogs. Linking to applicable and reputable websites not only offers blog readers additional reading material to expand their knowledge, but it also shows Google and other search engines that youâ€™ve done your research. And the blogger or writer may even return the favor and link to your site.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nothing strengthens a blog post like hard-to-argue-with, research-backed statistics from influential websites. Compelling stats help you build a more convincing and concrete argument that will get your readers thinking (especially when theyâ€™re from trustworthy sites they know and love).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;4) Aim for scannable, longer posts&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In an age of short attention spans (&lt;a href="http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/"&gt;average of 8 seconds for humans&lt;/a&gt;), you would think shorter blog posts are the way to go. But search engines actually prefer longer, in-depth blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The longer your blog post, the greater its chance of appearing in the top search engine results. &lt;a href="http://blog.serpiq.com/how-important-is-content-length-why-data-driven-seo-trumps-guru-opinions/"&gt;SerpIQ found&lt;/a&gt; that the 10th position pages have 400 fewer words than 1st position pages. Longer posts will rank more easily for your target keyword.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Think about it: the more content on the page, the more clues search engines have to figure out what your blog is about. We recommend writing a minimum of &lt;a href="https://yoast.com/blog-post-length/"&gt;300 words per blog post&lt;/a&gt;. This length gives search engines plenty of keywords and text to crawl and helps them understand what your blog is about.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The downside to longer blogs is that they may scare off your readers. We live in a world of skimmers and scanners. In a heat map analysis, &lt;a href="http://coschedule.com/"&gt;CoSchedule&lt;/a&gt; learned that &lt;a href="http://coschedule.com/blog/read-your-content/"&gt;only 10-20% of their readers&lt;/a&gt; were making it to the bottom of their posts. So, the million dollar question is, how can longer blog posts appeal to todayâ€™s online readers?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You can write &lt;a href="http://experience.stratusinteractive.com/blog/scannable-content-your-key-to-writing-successful-blogs"&gt;scannable&lt;/a&gt;, readable blog posts that hook online readers by tightening up your sentences and paragraphs. Turn a long-winded sentence into two. Keep your paragraphs to 2-3 sentences max.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Also, take full advantage of bulleted lists and subheadings that grab readerâ€™s attention. By following these tactics, youâ€™ll create blogs that are easier to read (especially on a mobile device!) and less intimidating to the scannerâ€™s eye.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;5) Donâ€™t forget internal links&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Linking to other pages or blog posts on your website helps search engines crawl your website and create a more accurate sitemap. It also helps your audience discover more of your content and get to know you as a trustworthy, credible source of information. Internal links to other valuable content keep users on your site longer, reducing bounce rate and increasing your potential for a conversion (and isnâ€™t that what itâ€™s all about?).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When linking to any pages on your website, or even outside sources, use natural language for your anchor text. Avoid using spammy or generic text such as â€œtop-rated cheap laptopsâ€ or â€œclick here.â€ Instead, use descriptive keywords that give readers a sense of what they will find when they click on the hyperlink, such as a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://hubs.ly/H05xGXn0"&gt;search engine optimization guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Never force feed links to your top webpages, featured products or discounted items. These types of links will only turn off readers and could lead to search engines penalizing your website.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A word of caution: donâ€™t overdo your internal linking or any linking. We know itâ€™s tempting to link to all of your blogs and webpages, but only choose the ones that best enhance the point or insight youâ€™re writing about in any particular blog. Always think about whether or not these links naturally tie in with the subject matter and if they will offer significant value to your readers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you want your blogs to rank at the top of page one (and why wouldnâ€™t you?), your main focus should be on creating blogs that both users and search engines will love. By optimizing your blogs for both, you can earn higher rankings in SERPs, get more qualified web traffic and increase conversion rates. And wasnâ€™t that the exact reason you started blogging to begin with?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How HubSpot Customers Grow: The Key Technologies Used by 19,000 Marketers</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-hubspot-customers-grow-technologies</link>
      <description>
        &lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-hubspot-customers-grow-technologies" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/ThinkstockPhotos-510231836-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="How HubSpot Customers Grow: The Key Technologies Used by 19,000 Marketers" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here at HubSpot, we've been giving a lot of thought to the concept of a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/growing-businesses-need-growth-stack"&gt;growth stack&lt;/a&gt; -- &lt;/em&gt;the set of tools that marketers and sales teams use to drive growth. As you might imagine, we're working to build our products to serve as a strong foundation for your growth stack. But what does that look like?&lt;/p&gt;
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ThinkstockPhotos-510231836-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=761&amp;amp;name=ThinkstockPhotos-510231836-compressor.jpg" alt="How HubSpot Customers Grow" width="761" title="How HubSpot Customers Grow" style="width: 761px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here at HubSpot, we've been giving a lot of thought to the concept of a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/growing-businesses-need-growth-stack"&gt;growth stack&lt;/a&gt; -- &lt;/em&gt;the set of tools that marketers and sales teams use to drive growth. As you might imagine, we're working to build our products to serve as a strong foundation for your growth stack. But what does that look like?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To dig deeper into what the typical growth stack looks like, we recently partnered with &lt;a href="https://www.datanyze.com/"&gt;Datanyze&lt;/a&gt;, a platform that can track a large number of technology categories. Together, we set out to determine what technologies HubSpot customers have enabled on their websites.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In this post, we'll break down our customer adoption, and show which of the more notable technologies are being used.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;7 Key Technologies Used by HubSpot Customers&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1) General Technologies&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/assets/hubspot.com/research/CHARTS/Datanyze%20post/New/page0.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=page0.png" width="669" style="width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Among HubSpot customers, we saw a widespread adoption of technologies that, when it comes to marketing and sales, are pretty standard -- things like analytics, email, social sharing, and CMS, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;2) Analytics Technologies&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/assets/hubspot.com/research/CHARTS/Datanyze%20post/New/page3-508363-edited.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=page3-508363-edited.png" width="669" style="width: 669px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Under the analytics category, we can see that Google dominates the market, with 98% of all HubSpot customers leveraging Google Analytics -- that's great market share.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What we found to be even more interesting was the supplementary set of tools that our customers use to enhance and disseminate their content, which follow below.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: The Leadin product has since been rolled into &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/free"&gt;HubSpot Marketing Free&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;3) Video Platforms&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/assets/hubspot.com/research/CHARTS/Datanyze%20post/New/page4-420683-edited.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=696&amp;amp;name=page4-420683-edited.png" width="696" style="width: 696px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Over half of our customers -- 53% -- have an online video platform enabled on their websites. We've seen from previous research that video is &lt;a href="https://research.hubspot.com/reports/the-future-of-content-marketing"&gt;very popular among consumers&lt;/a&gt;, and demand for video-based content continues to grow. Video adoption by our customers indicates a recognition of that demand -- They're keeping up with changing content preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The top-used video platform -- by wide margin -- is YouTube, followed by Vimeo and Wistia. Note: Many websites use multiple tools.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;4) Ad Networks and Retargeting&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/assets/hubspot.com/research/CHARTS/Datanyze%20post/New/page6-234787-edited.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=696&amp;amp;name=page6-234787-edited.png" width="696" style="width: 696px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A good number of customers -- 29% -- are also leveraging ad networks, and 26% are retargeting to reach a wider audience. True to our &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-inbound-marketing-training-deck#sm.0000e1w1nuwvbeo5sq61j1tim2kyj"&gt;inbound philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, our customers are focusing mostly on unobtrusive search ads and social media ads.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/assets/hubspot.com/research/CHARTS/Datanyze%20post/New/page8-456180-edited.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=696&amp;amp;name=page8-456180-edited.png" width="696" style="width: 696px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Retargeting, meanwhile, allows our customers to re-engage with prospects who may have left items in a shopping cart, or viewed specific webpages. For those efforts, 71% of customers use Facebook, with Google Remarketing and Dynamic Remarketing rounding out the top three tools.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;5) Support and Chat Technologies&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/assets/hubspot.com/research/CHARTS/Datanyze%20post/New/page11-330534-edited.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=696&amp;amp;name=page11-330534-edited.png" width="696" style="width: 696px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To better serve customers and prospects, about one out of five of the websites we examined enable support and chat tools, in order to directly communicate with website visitors. There's no obvious leader in the chat tooling space, with the majority of websites using lesser-known chat tools. In our sample, Zopim and LiveChat were the chat leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/assets/hubspot.com/research/CHARTS/Datanyze%20post/New/page9-380914-edited.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=696&amp;amp;name=page9-380914-edited.png" width="696" style="width: 696px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We saw a more clear-cut leader in the support tool space, with 44% of customers using support technologies opting for Zendesk. As more customers expect on-demand service, businesses who hoping to leverage superior service as a differentiator will continue to invest in both support and chat technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;6) Payment and Ecommerce Tools&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/assets/hubspot.com/research/CHARTS/Datanyze%20post/New/page7-550301-edited.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=967&amp;amp;name=page7-550301-edited.png" width="967" style="width: 967px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The last technologies crucial to growth are ecommerce and payment tools. Obviously, businesses and buyers alike always welcome a seamless way to collect payment.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Overall, payments and ecommerce show relatively low adoption, with just 4% and 2% of websites using each respective technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For websites with payment collection capabilities, 33% use PayPal and 21% use Stripe. The rest of the market is scattered among smaller players.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/assets/hubspot.com/research/CHARTS/Datanyze%20post/New/page10-285154-edited.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=1000&amp;amp;name=page10-285154-edited.png" width="1000" style="width: 1000px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;WooCommerce is a leader in the ecommerce category, with 43% market share within our sample.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;7) Other Observations Based on Demographics&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/assets/hubspot.com/research/CHARTS/Datanyze%20post/New/page2.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=1176&amp;amp;name=page2.png" width="1176" style="width: 1176px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finally, we crunched the numbers and reviewed technology adoption based on our customer demographics. We found some interesting differences, and plan to follow this research with additional insights from our data set.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, check out some of the more interesting figures we discovered:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;34% of B2C companies use retargeting, compared to 24% of B2B companies -- a 10% difference.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;44% of larger companies (more than 1,000 employees) use advertising networks, versus 27% of small businesses (1 to 50 employees).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Our customers in France have the highest use of online video platforms (49%), while Brazil had the lowest (43%).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Brazilian customers had the highest use of retargeting software (41%). Only 12% of customer in the Netherlands had retargeting enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Companies in the software industry have the highest use of support and feedback tools (21%).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;ecommerce sites have the highest use of both retargeting tools (50%) and chat software (31%).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Non-profit and education sites have the highest use of online video platforms (68% and 66%, respectively).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;What's in Your Growth Stack?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The technology groupings identified in this data are powerful levers for rapid growth. By examining the use of video, ad networks, retargeting, support, chat, ecommerce, and payments, you might begin to see what a growth stack could look like for your business.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Ultimate List of Free Content Creation Tools &amp; Resources</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-content-marketing-tools-list</link>
      <description>
        &lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-content-marketing-tools-list" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/ultimate-list-content-creation-tools.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="The Ultimate List of Free Content Creation Tools &amp;amp; Resources" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Creating content isn't always a walk in the park. (In fact, it can sometimes feel more like trying to swim against the current.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While other parts of business and marketing are becoming increasingly automated, content creation is still a very manual job.&lt;/p&gt;
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ultimate-list-content-creation-tools.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=761&amp;amp;name=ultimate-list-content-creation-tools.jpg" alt="ultimate-list-content-creation-tools.jpg" title="ultimate-list-content-creation-tools.jpg" width="761" style="width: 761px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Creating content isn't always a walk in the park. (In fact, it can sometimes feel more like trying to swim against the current.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While other parts of business and marketing are becoming increasingly automated, content creation is still a very manual job.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That being said, there are plenty of tools out there to make creating content much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/content-creation-templates"&gt;Click here to download our full collection of content creation templates for blog posts, ebooks, infographics, and more.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Below, you'll find a list of 36 fantastic tools and resources to help you research, write, edit, and design content more easily. (You'll notice there are a lot of design tools in here -- that's because visual content is often the part of the content creation process where people get the most nervous and frustrated. So don't worry, we've got a ton in there for you.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Let's get started.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;36 Free Tools &amp;amp; Resources to Make Content Creation Easier&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;For Researchers&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;1) &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2481802?hl=en"&gt;Google Drive Research Tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Google recently added a tool to Drive that allows you to conduct Google searches without ever leaving your Drive window. All you have to do is click "Tools" from the menu bar and choose "Research" from the dropdown menu.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/google-drive-research-tool.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=google-drive-research-tool.png" alt="google-drive-research-tool.png" title="google-drive-research-tool.png" width="669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;2) &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-search-tips#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;Site:search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a handy Google hack I use every day. Basically, it allows you to do a Google search that's limited to a particular website.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For example, if I wanted to search HubSpot's blog for marketing resources so I can cite one of our old blog posts, I'd do a site:search for blog.hubspot.com with the search term &lt;em&gt;marketing resources.&lt;/em&gt; The formula for site search is &lt;strong&gt;site:samplewebsite.com [search query]. &lt;/strong&gt;So my example would be &lt;strong&gt;site:blog.hubspot.com marketing resources.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/googlesitesearch.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=798&amp;amp;name=googlesitesearch.png" alt="googlesitesearch.png" title="googlesitesearch.png" width="798" style="width: 798px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;3) &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en"&gt;Google Webmaster Tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Doing SEO and keyword research? Your marketing software should be able to help. But if it can't (or you'd like to augment your data), Google's Webmaster Tools can be a great help. You can check things like the number of indexed pages on your website, submit your site to Google so you're getting crawled and indexed, and even disavow bad inbound links. It also can give you information on search queries that have a large volume of impressions but low clickthrough rate.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Within &lt;span class="il"&gt;Google &lt;span class="il"&gt;Webmaster &lt;span class="il"&gt;Tools, go to "Your site on the web" and choose "Search queries." You'll see a table showing a search query, impressions, clicks, and clickthrough rate (CTR). Comparing this data to your other analytics data can help uncover some opportunities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;4) &lt;a href="http://percent-change.com/"&gt;Percentage Change Calculator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I can't even begin to tell you how useful this little calculator is when looking for and analyzing data. Ever want to know the percentage change of two values without having to remember the formula? Simply enter the two values into this calculator, and it'll spit out the percentage change. Trust me, you'll want to bookmark this one.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here are a few other handy calculators:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.math.com/students/calculators/source/3percent.htm"&gt;3-Way Percentage Calculator&lt;/a&gt; â€“ &lt;/strong&gt;Calculates answers to these questions: What is X% of Y? X is what percent of Y? X is Y% of what?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.marketingforsuccess.com/marketing-calculator-4/"&gt;Conversion Rate Calculator&lt;/a&gt; â€“&lt;/strong&gt; Spits out a conversion rate when you enter the total visitor count during a specific time frame and the number of times during that time frame those visitors took a specific action.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://drpete.co/split-test-calculator"&gt;A/B Test Calculator&lt;/a&gt; â€“ &lt;/strong&gt;Works for a basic scenario with two groups of people (A &amp;amp; B) who get to see one version of your website and for whom you track the number of conversions or goals (purchases, downloads, clickthroughs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/roi-calculator"&gt;ROI Calculator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;â€“ &lt;/strong&gt;Analyzes your website's monthly sales and lead generation efforts to determine ways in which marketing efforts can be optimized.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;5) &lt;a href="https://www.theatlas.com/"&gt;Atlas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Atlas is &lt;a href="http://qz.com/"&gt;Quartz&lt;/a&gt;'s data center, and it's chock-full of graphs, charts, and data visualizations. You can search for almost any topic or keyword, and Atlas will have a graphic based on recent research data for you. This is a great tool to get background information on a topic you're researching, or to find fresh data to use in a project you're working on. Here's a chart based on data from early 2016:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/atlas%20dogs.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;height=542&amp;amp;name=atlas%20dogs.png" alt="atlas dogs.png" width="730" height="542" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Source: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlas.com/charts/N1eqlH6Tg"&gt;Atlas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;6) &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/search-in-a-giphy/jlleokkdhkflpmghiioglgmnminbekdi?hl=en"&gt;Search in a Giphy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You know that coworker who always seems to find the perfect animated GIFs for your social posts or internal chat client? With the free Giphy Chrome extension, you'll be able to find great GIFs just as quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To use the tool, all you have to do is open the extension in Chrome, search, choose a GIF, and drag and drop. So far, the tool works in Gmail, Twitter, Facebook, and more -- and they're constantly expanding support.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="webstore-Vb-nd-bc-Db-t" style="text-align: center;"&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/search-in-a-giphy.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=638&amp;amp;name=search-in-a-giphy.png" alt="search-in-a-giphy.png" title="search-in-a-giphy.png" width="638"&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;For Writers&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;7) &lt;a href="http://evernote.com/"&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I use the free version of Evernote every single day. From to-do lists and research notes to writing entire chunks of articles, it's proven helpful at every step of the writing and editing process.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One great feature? Its mobile, desktop, and web apps sync automatically as long as you have an internet connection. (And if you work offline, it'll sync the next time you have internet.) Plus -- and this is super important for content creators like us -- it's constantly saving and syncing your work automatically, making it a safe place to write and store ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-tools-run-business#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;Use it&lt;/a&gt; to keep a running list of ideas, take notes, store inspiring articles or ebooks, or plan your editorial and &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-calendar-tools"&gt;social media publishing calendars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/evernote-screenshot.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=evernote-screenshot.png" alt="evernote-screenshot.png" title="evernote-screenshot.png" width="669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;8) &lt;a href="http://word2cleanhtml.com/"&gt;Word2CleanHTML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you like drafting blog posts in programs like Microsoft Word, Evernote, or Google Drive instead of your content management system (CMS), then this simple tool can be your best friend. Why? Because when you copy a document from Microsoft Office and paste it into your CMS, lots of little, weird formatting issues can crop up in your HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Word2CleanHTML applies filters to fix all those things added into the HTML, resulting in well-formatted HTML you can paste directly into a web page CMS. Simply paste in your draft, click one button, and then copy the resulting HTML straight from the tool. When you paste that into your CMS (most will have buttons reading "HTML" or "&amp;lt;/&amp;gt;" in their tool bar above your draft), it will appear nice and clean. No hair-pulling or swimming through code required.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;9) &lt;a href="http://www.wordcounter.net/"&gt;WordCounter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There is no "right answer" for &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/character-limit-social-media-blog-posts#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;how long a blog post should be&lt;/a&gt;. As long as it serves its purpose -- whether that's thought leadership, driving leads, explaining a new concept, or something else -- length doesn't matter. But although we don't recommend writing blog posts with a word count in mind, sometimes word count can come in handy. WordCounter works exactly the way you think it does: Paste in your content and it'll spit out exactly how many words you have.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;10) &lt;a href="https://coffitivity.com/"&gt;Cofftivity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.inc.com/welcome.html?destination=http://www.inc.com/kelsey-libert/8-tips-for-staying-productive-while-working-from-home.html"&gt;a study out of the University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, "A moderate level of ambient noise is conducive to creative cognition." In other words, being the tiniest bit distracted actually helps you be more creative. That's why for many people, myself included, white noise helps promote focus.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of white noise generators out there, but my favorite is Cofftivity. This particular one offers non-stop cafÃ© background sounds at varying intensities, from "Morning Murmur" and "University Undertones" to "Lunchtime Lounge" and "Brazil Bistro." It's available on the web and as an app on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;11) &amp;amp; 12) &lt;a href="http://www.zerys.com/"&gt;Zerys&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://www.elance.com/category/writing"&gt;eLance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Need to start creating content but don't have the bandwidth? We hear about this roadblock a lot. One way to get around it is by hiring freelancers from reputable marketplaces like Zerys or eLance. These resources give you access to skilled freelance writers who can write blog posts, ebooks, whitepapers, and other pieces of written content for you.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;13) &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/html-hacks-for-marketers"&gt;HTML Hacks for Marketers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While this isn't strictly a writing resource, basic coding knowledge is quickly &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/learn-to-code-resources"&gt;becoming a must-have skill&lt;/a&gt; for the modern marketer -- bloggers and written content creators included. But learning from scratch can be daunting. Where on earth do you start?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you're a total beginner, start with &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/html-hacks-for-marketers"&gt;HTML Hacks for Marketers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which my colleagues at HubSpot created with &lt;a href="http://www.codecademy.com/"&gt;Codeacademy&lt;/a&gt;. It'll teach you quick but useful hacks anyone -- regardless of coding knowledge -- can use in their marketing. For example, you'll learn how to make small changes to HTML like altering headers and spacing, creating text in block-quote form, and inserting social share links. My personal favorite is the hack to change font colors.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once you've mastered these basic HTML skills, move on to &lt;a href="http://www.codecademy.com/"&gt;Codeacademy's free interactive courses&lt;/a&gt;. They found a way to make learning HTML and CSS actually fun -- and you can go through each lesson at your own pace.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;14) &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/blog-topic-generator"&gt;Blog Topic Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you need to get to writing blog posts but aren't sure of an angle or title to get your creativity moving, HubSpot's &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/blog-topic-generator"&gt;Blog Topic Generator&lt;/a&gt; can do the work for you. Simply enter a few keywords that your blog focuses on, and the Blog Topic Generator will produce a week's worth of titles and topic ideas for you. It might not produce the final title of your blog post, but it helps get you thinking about creative new angles for topics you've written about before.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here are the blog post titles I received when I entered "content," "inbound marketing," and "blogging":&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/generator_contentcreation.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;height=315&amp;amp;name=generator_contentcreation.png" alt="generator_contentcreation.png" width="730" height="315"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;15) &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/blog-post-templates?_ga=1.116991174.170111609.1470925141"&gt;Blog Post Templates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All blog posts aren't created equal, but we've found that there are steps you can take to make your posts comprehensive and shareable. With these &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/blog-post-templates?_ga=1.187909352.170111609.1470925141"&gt;blog post templates&lt;/a&gt;, we'll walk you through an outline to write successful how-to, listicle, newsjack, and curation blog posts. Instead of starting from scratch, you'll save time and, hopefully, nail your blog goals.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;For Content Editors&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;16) &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/blog-editorial-calendar?_ga=1.116991174.170111609.1470925141"&gt;Editorial Calendar Template&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Creating a balanced editorial calendar can be tough, especially if you don't have one centralized calendar that you and your team can refer to. To save you time and headache, we've created &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/blog-editorial-calendar"&gt;editorial calendar templates&lt;/a&gt; for Google Calendar, Google Sheets, and Excel that you can fill in and share with your team to start the next month or year off on the right foot.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;17) &amp;amp; 18) &lt;a href="https://www.grammarly.com/"&gt;Grammarly&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://www.correctica.com/"&gt;Correctica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While human editors will be able to catch most grammatical errors, editing tools like Grammarly and Correctica are great tools for triple-checking before you press "publish" or "send." Both free tools check for grammatical errors -- and Grammarly even checks for plagiarism.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4 style="font-weight: 600;"&gt;19) &lt;a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/"&gt;Hemingway App&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ernest Hemingway, admired for his succinct writing style, is the namesake for this handy editing app. Want to make your written content easier to read? Paste your content into this free web app, and it'll assess your writing and identify opportunities to make it simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My favorite features include identifying passive voice and hard-to-read sentences. Check out the right-hand side of the screenshot below, where the tool has summed up how readable my writing is with a grade. (Some room for improvement here.) Their suggestion to improve readability overall? Shoot for lower than a 10th grade reading level.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hemingway-app-screenshot.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=hemingway-app-screenshot.png" alt="hemingway-app-screenshot.png" title="hemingway-app-screenshot.png" width="669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;20) &lt;a href="http://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer"&gt;Headline Analyzer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here's a scary stat for you: &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/03/19/americans-read-headlines-and-not-much-else/?utm_term=.52a4e23c4d08"&gt;Only 60%&lt;/a&gt; of people who click into an article end up reading past the headline. That makes your headline both the first and possibly the only chance for you to compel readers to keep reading -- so it's totally worth it to spend the extra few minutes coming up with a really good one.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What does a really good headline look like? The free tool Headline Analyzer by CoSchedule can tell you. It scores your headline quality and rates its ability to drive social shares, traffic, and SEO value. In my experience, its strength is helping you strengthen specific components of your title. For example, it reports on perceived sentiment and commonality of word types. It'll even show you how it will appear in search results.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So although you should take these scores and grades with a grain of salt, you can use this to give your headlines a â€œonce-over." (And &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-simple-formula-for-writing-kick-ass-titles-ht"&gt;read this blog post to learn more about writing awesome headlines&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;For Designers&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;21) &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nimbus-screenshot/bpconcjcammlapcogcnnelfmaeghhagj?hl=en"&gt;Nimbus Screenshot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is another tool I use every day. Sure, you can capture a screenshot of your entire screen or part of your screen using the old &lt;a href="http://www.take-a-screenshot.org/"&gt;keyboard shortcut method&lt;/a&gt;. But what if you want your screenshot to include stuff that's not visible on your screen?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nimbus Screenshot lets you capture the visible part of a web page, a selected area, a selected scroll (my personal favorite), the entire page, or the entire browser window -- including everything below the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/nimbus-screenshot.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=387&amp;amp;name=nimbus-screenshot.png" alt="nimbus-screenshot.png" title="nimbus-screenshot.png" width="387"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once you've taken the screenshot, you can crop, edit (like adding notes and callouts), and choose to print or save to your desktop or Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;22) &lt;a href="http://canva.com"&gt;Canva&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you like creating beautiful &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-visual-content-tools-list#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;visual content&lt;/a&gt; in a really short amount of time, you'll love Canva. The time and resources it takes to learn design, pay for design assets, and/or get inspired to create beauty from scratch can be really difficult when you're staring at a long list of to-dos -- but Canva offers a huge library of pre-made templates and assets that you can manipulate while also adding your own imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Best of all, they have so many assets and graphics available for free that you won't have to pay a cent if you don't want to. If you want to use more "premium" assets and graphics found through their image search, they'll charge you $1 for each. But there's plenty of value for free.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here's an example of something you could make:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-409265072-png/Blog-Related_Images/hubspot_canva_example.png?t=1483790613555" alt="hubspot_canva_example" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;23) &lt;a href="http://thinglink.com"&gt;ThingLink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ever wanted to make an image (or infographic) clickable? ThingLink lets you upload an image and add little icons to it that appear when a person hovers their cursor over the image. These icons allow users to visit links, watch videos, or read messages you've written. Plus, it's easy to share: Users can easily embed ThingLink images. (&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-make-infographic-clickable"&gt;Click here for step-by-step instructions&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Below is part of a a clickable infographic from Thinglink my colleague &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ginnysoskey"&gt;Ginny Mineo&lt;/a&gt; created for &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/the-anatomy-of-a-shareable-infographic"&gt;another post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div style="display: block;"&gt;

        &amp;nbsp;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;24) &lt;a href="http://evernote.com/skitch/"&gt;Skitch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Skitch is a free app by Evernote that helps you communicate more visually. It lets you mark up images, digital assets, PDFs, and other files with arrows, callout boxes, text, and more all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the example below, I opened the program on my desktop and used the "Screen Snap" button to take a screenshot of a web page -- which then opened right in Skitch for editing and exporting.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/skitch-by-evernote.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=523&amp;amp;name=skitch-by-evernote.png" alt="skitch-by-evernote.png" title="skitch-by-evernote.png" width="523"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Although it's free, it does require you to &lt;a href="https://evernote.com/"&gt;open an Evernote account&lt;/a&gt; -- but that's also free (see above).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;25) &lt;a href="http://infogr.am"&gt;Infogram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While similar to Canva, Infogram is a visual content tool that focuses on helping you create infographics, charts, and data visualization. If you like to create charts using Microsoft Excel, you're in luck -- it also offers compatibility with Excel through Infogram Charts. Also, their infographics are responsive with mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;26) &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/infographic-templates?_ga=1.79441364.170111609.1470925141"&gt;Infographic Templates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a content marketer, you might feel more comfortable creating written content than visual content, but that's no excuse to exclude&amp;nbsp;infographics from your strategy. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;Visual content&lt;/a&gt; is growing in demand from your audience, and infographics are particularly shareable. We've created the backbones of 15 different templates that you can easily play around with to customize for your content and audience -- here's a sneak peek of one template, and you can&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/infographic-templates"&gt;grab the rest here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;27) &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/fonts"&gt;Google Fonts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Want to spruce up your site pages, presentations, ebooks, and other content with cool and different new fonts? Little-known fact: Google has a directory of 600 free fonts ready for you to download and use.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Simply find and select the fonts you like from &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/fonts"&gt;their directory&lt;/a&gt;, then click "Use" to get the HTML code you can copy and paste onto your site. Alternatively, you can download the fonts to your desktop and use them when making new marketing content by clicking "Add to Collection." (&lt;a href="https://help.hubspot.com/articles/KCS_Article/COS-General/How-do-I-add-Google-Fonts-to-my-new-Landing-Pages"&gt;Click here for step-by-step instructions for doing this in the HubSpot software&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/google-web-fonts.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=google-web-fonts.png" alt="google-web-fonts.png" title="google-web-fonts.png" width="669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;28) &lt;a href="http://www.imagecolorpicker.com/"&gt;Image Color Picker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Remember that time you wanted to match your call-to-action design to that color you were using on all your event swag ... but the one person who would know what that color was didn't work at your company anymore? Next time that happens, snag a picture of that swag and upload it to &lt;a href="http://www.imagecolorpicker.com/"&gt;ImageColorPicker.com&lt;/a&gt;, or use any image URL to do the same thing. Select any point of the picture, and immediately see its corresponding HEX, RGB, and HSV values.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;29) &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/templates-create-beautiful-powerpoints?_ga=1.79441364.170111609.1470925141"&gt;PowerPoint Templates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Is there anything more boring than a PowerPoint presentation featuring black text on a white background? With the help of these &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/templates-create-beautiful-powerpoints?_ga=1.116073798.170111609.1470925141"&gt;templates&lt;/a&gt;, you'll be able to put together compelling, visually appealing presentations. Whether you're driving lead generation or reporting on your blog's growth to your team, keep your audience's attention with these eye-catching presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;30) &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/powerpoint-template-for-killer-slideshare-presentations?_ga=1.79441364.170111609.1470925141"&gt;SlideShare Templates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;SlideShare doesn't need to be daunting. You can easily create shareable, embeddable &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/powerpoint-template-for-killer-slideshare-presentations?_ga=1.78826964.170111609.1470925141"&gt;SlideShare presentations&lt;/a&gt; in PowerPoint with the help of these templates -- no need to start from scratch or hire a freelancer. Once you've created your first presentation, check out our guide to &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/slideshare-marketing-guide#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;marketing SlideShares successfully&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;31) &lt;a href="http://www.haikudeck.com/"&gt;Haiku Deck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you've ever had to create a PowerPoint or SlideShare presentation in a pinch, you'll wish you knew about Haiku Deck. This tool helps you quickly find simple layouts, beautiful images, and great fonts. It's available for the web and for iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Want to see what one looks like? Below's an example I pulled from their &lt;a href="https://www.haikudeck.com/snowed-in-education-presentation-OuhVv4ZyNM#slide-17"&gt;list of featured decks&lt;/a&gt;. Note the simplicity of the design -- if you want to create super detailed slides, this may not be the right tool for you.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;iframe src="https://www.haikudeck.com/e/OuhVv4ZyNM/?isUrlHashEnabled=false&amp;amp;isPreviewEnabled=false&amp;amp;isHeaderVisible=false" width="640" height="541" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"&gt;&lt;a title="Snowed In? Education Presentation" href="https://www.haikudeck.com/p/OuhVv4ZyNM/snowed-in?utm_campaign=embed&amp;amp;utm_source=webapp&amp;amp;utm_medium=text-link"&gt;Snowed In?&lt;/a&gt; - Created with Haiku Deck, presentation software that inspires&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;div style="display: block;"&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;32) &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/75-free-stock-photos-im-ht"&gt;HubSpot's Free Stock Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Searching for and buying stock imagery can be a pain in the you-know-what -- especially when it comes to deciphering legalese for different use cases. I have a liberal arts degree, and Nietzsche was easier to read than whatever legalese stock imagery companies tended to give me. All I wanted to know is whether to cite or not cite a stock image of a laptop. Why was it so hard?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That's why our team decided to create a library of 550+ free and royalty-free &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/most-searched-for-free-stock-photos?_ga=1.121323976.170111609.1470925141"&gt;stock photos&lt;/a&gt;. Whether it's a unique image needed for an ebook or that perfect photo you want to add to a blog post, that collection should have you covered. Here's one of our "around the kitchen" stock photos -- yum.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/candy-3.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;height=487&amp;amp;name=candy-3.jpg" alt="candy-3.jpg" width="730" height="487" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Source: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/most-searched-for-free-stock-photos?_ga=1.121323976.170111609.1470925141"&gt;The Free Stock Photos You've Been Searching For&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;33) &lt;a href="http://placeit.net"&gt;PlaceIt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;PlaceIt serves a very specific purpose: It allows you to upload images of your site or product into real-world environments of people holding phones, tablets, and laptops. PlaceIt will automatically alter the image to make it appear natural with the angle of the phone's screen -- which will save you time learning and/or editing in more advanced software to get the angle right.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/place-it-example.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=614&amp;amp;name=place-it-example.png" alt="place-it-example.png" title="place-it-example.png" width="614"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You'll have to pay per image to get really large or high-resolution versions, though I've found free images work just fine for blog posts and product page content. The paid downloads also remove that PlaceIt watermark from the bottom right.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;34)&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://licecap.en.softonic.com/"&gt;LICEcap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Looking for the perfect GIF to include in your blog post? If it doesn't already exist on &lt;a href="http://giphy.com/"&gt;Giphy,&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;you can make one yourself using LICEcap. Film a screenshot and turn it into a GIF using this handy, free tool -- we use &lt;a href="https://licecap.en.softonic.com/"&gt;LICEcap&lt;/a&gt; for our &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-create-a-snapchat-story#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;35) &amp;amp; 36) &lt;a href="https://thenounproject.com/"&gt;The Noun Project&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/free-icons"&gt;HubSpot's Resizable Icons Collection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Like with stock photos, another challenge content creators face is finding elegant icons that resize without getting all fuzzy. There are a few resources out there for great, resizable icons.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thenounproject.com/"&gt;The Noun Project&lt;/a&gt; is an extensive library of thousands of icons uploaded by contributors. With a free account, you can use icons as long as you either give credit to the creator or purchase them royalty-free for $1.99 apiece.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/free-icons"&gt;HubSpot has a library of resizeable icons&lt;/a&gt;, too, which you can download for free and without any licensing or attribution. The kit comes with a free guide for how to change the color of the icons using PowerPoint, Photoshop, and Illustrator.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To that, we say ...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-410916445-png/Blog-Related_Images/general-icons-26.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=75&amp;amp;name=general-icons-26.png" alt="general-icons-26" width="75" style="width: 75px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px;"&gt;(From &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/free-icons"&gt;HubSpot's Free Icon Collection&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div style="display: block;"&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;It's Not the Wand, It's the Wizard&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The tools and resources listed above can help you create, but it's ultimately up to you to control the quality of your content. You still need to know your customer incredibly well, understand what challenges they face that your product or service solves, and create content that helps them address those challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The brains and heart behind the content creator trump the code behind any tools and technology -- and that's a good thing for succeeding in marketing today.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What other tools or apps do you use to create content more easily? Leave them in the comments so we can extend this list right here!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Submit Your Website to Google (And Why It Matters)</title>

      <description>
        &lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/submit-website-google" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Submit-Site-to-Google-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="How to Submit Your Website to Google (And Why It Matters)" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So, you've developed an amazing site. You've put together some seriously valuable content, iterated on the design, and gathered a ton of feedback. Now, you're finally feeling ready to share it with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And as soon as you publish your new site for the world to see, all of your content will immediately start showing up in Google, right?&lt;/p&gt;
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Submit-Site-to-Google-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;name=Submit-Site-to-Google-compressor.jpg" alt="Submit-Site-to-Google" width="730" title="Submit-Site-to-Google" style="width: 730px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So, you've developed an amazing site. You've put together some seriously valuable content, iterated on the design, and gathered a ton of feedback. Now, you're finally feeling ready to share it with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And as soon as you publish your new site for the world to see, all of your content will immediately start showing up in Google, right?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Well, maybe. Although, it takes a little more than just hitting the publish button. To get your site listed, you'll need to check a few boxes first. Let's walk through it ...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;How Google Finds Your Content&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Google, in its own words, uses a huge set of computers to crawl billions of pages on the web. This crawler, called the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/182072?hl=en"&gt;Googlebot&lt;/a&gt;, essentially begins with a list of web page URLs generated from previous crawls and then augments those pages with sitemap data provided within &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en"&gt;Google Search Console&lt;/a&gt;. During the crawling process, the Googlebot looks for new sites, updates to existing pages, and any broken links.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If new pages are within your sitemap, Google will discover them and crawl the content and then potentially list the page within search results based on its evaluation of 200+ criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once the crawling process is completed all of the results are fed into Google's index, and any new sites or updated content will be listed accordingly. During the processing of results, Google looks at information on your page such as title tags, meta description, alt tags, and more. If you have dynamic content on a page, the Googlebot may not be able to read it and will crawl the default version -- it's recommended that your default version is optimized for search.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a result of Google's crawling, you may never need to submit your website as it will be discovered automatically. The downside to this approach has always been that it's reliant on Google's timeframe to crawl and index your site content, which may not happen as quickly as you would like.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Want to check if a particular site is listed in Google? Just begin your search with "Site:&lt;em&gt;Sitename.com.&lt;/em&gt;" For example, here's what is displayed in Google for HubSpot.com:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google-Site-Search-1.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;name=Google-Site-Search-1.png" alt="Google-Site-Search-1.png" width="640" style="width: 640px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If no content is indexed yet for a site&lt;/strong&gt;, Google will let you know that your search did not match any results.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If no content is found,&lt;/strong&gt; your next step should be to create a sitemap that can be submitted to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you want more information about &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/build-sitemap-website#sm.000013mq2bt8wgd5gqbknjh5kzdbp"&gt;how to create a sitemap&lt;/a&gt;, take a look at this post.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(HubSpot customers: Your sitemap is automatically generated and maintained. Simply go to yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml to see it.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;How Long Does It Take to Index Content?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My colleague &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseyhen"&gt;Casey Henry&lt;/a&gt; wondered this very question and ran a test to see how long it took Yahoo and Google to crawl and index content. The results? Well, they were staggering.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When publishing content without manually submitting an updated sitemap, Henry found that it took Google 1,375 minutes to crawl, while Yahoo took 1,773 minutes. To put those numbers into perspective, that's roughly a full-day just to crawl your content.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/crawl-time-no-sitemap.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=438&amp;amp;name=crawl-time-no-sitemap.jpg" alt="crawl-time-no-sitemap.jpg" width="600" height="438" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://moz.com/blog/do-sitemaps-effect-crawlers"&gt;Moz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On the other hand if you are launching a new website, or adding a number of new pages, it may be worth submitting an updated sitemap. According to the same study, Henry found that after submitting an updated sitemap, the average time it took for a bot to visit the page was 14 minutes, compared to 245 minutes for Yahoo. In other words, your new page can start generating organic traffic and conversions on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/crawl-time-with-sitemap.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=438&amp;amp;name=crawl-time-with-sitemap.jpg" alt="crawl-time-with-sitemap.jpg" width="600" height="438" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://moz.com/blog/do-sitemaps-effect-crawlers"&gt;Moz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;How Do I Submit My Site to Google?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have a brand new site&lt;/strong&gt;, you should first verify you own the site within Google Search Console and then &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/submit-url"&gt;submit it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; If you have an existing site and are launching a number of new pages&lt;/strong&gt;, then instead you should submit an updated sitemap to ensure it gets listed as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google-Site-Submission.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Google-Site-Submission.png" alt="Google-Site-Submission.png" width="669" title="Google-Site-Submission.png" style="width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To submit an updated sitemap, log in to Google Search Console &amp;gt; Crawl tab &amp;gt; Sitemaps. Once you're there you can submit your updated sitemap for Google so it can begin crawling it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Based on the above, you may be asking if you need to submit an updated sitemap &lt;em&gt;every time&lt;/em&gt; you publish a page. While you certainly could do so, it's best to manually go through the submission process if you're working with critically important content that needs to be indexed quickly. &lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;If you're just making minor updates or corrections to pages, then it may be ok to wait until Google crawls that page and updates its index.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you generally submit an updated sitemap when you publish new content? Let us know what you think in the comments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;a class="cta_button" href="https://offers.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=3d7cbac9-0e99-4d21-a709-4046bb35eada&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid="&gt; &lt;img class="hs-cta-img " style="border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; " alt="seo myths 2017" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3d7cbac9-0e99-4d21-a709-4046bb35eada.png"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;

      <title>How One Simple Change Can Improve Your Client and Employee Satisfaction Rates</title>

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Making a U-turn in a Ford Focus is easier than in an 18-wheeler.&lt;/p&gt;
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/00-Blog_Thinkstock_Images/one-change-improve-client.png?t=1483790613555"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Making a U-turn in a Ford Focus is easier than in an 18-wheeler.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the same sense, making substantial changes to your &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/agency-org-structures"&gt;company structure&lt;/a&gt; is much easier at an agency of 10 people than an agency that has grown to 50 or more.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But that challenge and discomfort shouldn't keep you from working to improve your agency's structure. If you approach the process strategically and for the right reasons, change can be a positive force for your company -- and it could potentially result in pretty impressive growth in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When my content marketing agency, &lt;a href="https://www.influenceandco.com/"&gt;Influence &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/a&gt;, grew to about 50 people a year and a half ago, we decided to change our entire company structure.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When I discuss this change with my fellow agency leaders, they often think (at least initially) that a switch to a &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/client-based-team"&gt;client-based team structure&lt;/a&gt; instead of siloed departments would be chaotic, difficult, and possibly negative for clients who were used to and preferred the existing model.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But change -- even major structural and procedural change -- doesn't have to create chaos.&lt;/strong&gt; If you and your leadership team manage development effectively and commit to transparent communication with your team and clients, you might be surprised by &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-structure-content-marketing-team"&gt;how smooth the process&lt;/a&gt; can be.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you're considering making a change within your own agency's &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-team-structure"&gt;team structure&lt;/a&gt;, take a look at whether an approach like ours would work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Why We Saw Change on the Horizon&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In our agency's infancy, our client services team was divided into departments by role. Our account strategists managed sets of clients from their own department, while editors, in a separate department, worked on content for all clients according to their individual capacities.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a fairly common structure for content agencies, &lt;strong&gt;but its prevalence doesn't mean it's perfect&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, we found it was responsible for a number of inefficiencies and incidents of tension between departments.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A lack of regular contact between editors and clients often left editors in the dark about concerns like strategy and tone, which resulted in a disconnect that reduced content quality. Account strategists were split between two very different job functions: account management and content strategy. This not only left them feeling stretched too thin, but also made it difficult for us to hire and train content marketers &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; project managers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This problematic disconnect made it challenging for us to effectively service clients, and kept our employees from performing at their best. We knew we needed a change -- we just had to determine what it would look like.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;How One Change Can Improve Everything&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After six months of internal research and planning, we rolled out the client-based structure we use today.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rather than separate departments, we &lt;a href="https://blog.influenceandco.com/the-essential-team-members-of-your-content-marketing-strategy"&gt;designed smaller teams called "pods"&lt;/a&gt; that include three team members essential to an effective content strategy who collaborate to serve their assigned clients. Each pod contains an account strategist who manages client relationships, a content strategist who manages client campaigns, and an editor who manages content creation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The pod structure completely broke down the silos that kept our client-facing team members from working together as efficiently as we knew they could&lt;/strong&gt;. The new structure also included dividing the account strategist role into two positions, which allows the three pod members to specialize in their own areas of expertise. And because these team members are dedicated to working together and serving their shared group of clients, they each understand those clients, those clientsâ€™ strategies, and one anotherâ€™s roles much more thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Because of the targeted focus on client service and employee performance, this change has helped our company grow and improve by every metric we measure.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Our client lifetime has grown by 30%, client satisfaction -- as measured by Net Promoter Score -- improved by 29% three months after the change; employee satisfaction has risen by 23%; and &lt;strong&gt;our top-line revenue has grown by more than 50% since the switch.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Planning for growth has also become easier. In the past, the resignation of one account strategist meant we'd need to transfer all his clients to other account strategists right away. That back-and-forth transfer of clients weakened the client experience and added stress to other team members. Now if one person in a pod leaves, that client has two other familiar faces he or she can trust and continue working with while the third role is being filled.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Plus, the remaining pod members can temporarily pick up the slack while we transition a new employee into the vacant role, giving us enough time to properly hire and train another team member.&lt;strong&gt; The entire structure is a much more stable approach to growth and client management than any we had before.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Get the Team Involved for Effective Change Management&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We did our best to roll out these structural and procedural changes -- big and small -- in a way that our team could embrace. What we didn't do was walk into the office one day and say, "Hey, everyone. All of your roles are changing. We're doing a pod thing now. Good luck!"&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conversations with team members began about six months before we actually shifted to a pod structure and about three months before our support-structure change.&lt;/strong&gt; Beginning with discovery conversations with people in all affected roles, we asked how employees thought it would impact their jobs and what resources they needed to make the transition smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We also asked our team to poke holes in each idea. What did they think wouldn't work about these changes? Were we overlooking something important? How could we make this even better?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With this information, we laid out a transition plan, communicated the changes to our team (including why we felt this plan was the right choice), and set aside an entire day to turn off client work and integrate into the new roles. And we haven't looked back since.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So whether you're behind the wheel of a Ford Focus or a semi-truck, change will be inevitable -- but there's no reason for it to drive you off the road. The major changes Influence &amp;amp; Co. has introduced over the past year and a half have resulted in amazing growth and improvement: Our clients are more satisfied, employees stay with us longer, and everyone reports feeling more supported.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Your agency is only as strong as your employees and their abilities to serve clients. &lt;strong&gt;Isn't it worth exploring the changes that might positively affect them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="cta_button" href="https://offers.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=8926ced4-92c6-4996-9496-2153cb4fd7ff&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid="&gt; &lt;img class="hs-cta-img " style="border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px" alt="creative-brief-cta" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/8926ced4-92c6-4996-9496-2153cb4fd7ff.png" align="middle"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>10 of the Best Out-of-Office Messages We Could Find</title>

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When it comes to the final days before vacation, people tend to fall into one of two camps: 1) those who watch the clock incessantly, and 2) those who are so busy before they leave, they might even forget to put up an out-of-office email message.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you're anything like I am, you probably fall into team two. That doesn't leave a lot of time to get creative. But if you plan ahead, you might be able to craft some hilarity.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If you're anything like I am, you probably fall into team two. That doesn't leave a lot of time to get creative. But if you plan ahead, you might be able to craft some hilarity.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Out-of-office messages run the gamut. From funny, to clever, to snarky, we've come across some of the best -- from Google, and from colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="cta_button" href="https://offers.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=9032c656-5488-4c0e-914a-b6d02e911f02&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid="&gt; &lt;img class="hs-cta-img " style="border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; " alt="Subscribe&amp;nbsp;to one of HubSpot's Blogs here to access our extended collection of  hilarious and entertaining OOO email templates.&amp;nbsp;" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9032c656-5488-4c0e-914a-b6d02e911f02.png"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here are some of the gems we found. And once you're back from vacation? Well, not to rush you, but this &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/email-productivity-hacks?utm_campaign=Marketing%20Blog%20-%20Internal%20Links%20%5BSeptember%5D&amp;amp;utm_medium=15%20of%20the%20Best%20Email%20Marketing%20Campaign%20Examples%20You%27ve%20Ever%20Seen&amp;amp;utm_source=Blog&amp;amp;_ga=1.57883306.1053898511.1470656920"&gt;email productivity guide&lt;/a&gt; can help you get back on track after your out-of-office time.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;10 Funny Out-of-Office Messages&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1) The Not-So-Tropical Getaway&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We'll give this guy first place, since we almost feel bad for him. Almost. Rather than using an out-of-office message for a tropical vacation, he used one to explain his absence during what would likely be a snow storm. Not only did it give us a chuckle, but it also generated a certain amount of empathy -- which is often the &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/empathetic-content-marketing-examples"&gt;key to good content&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;2) The Sorry-I'm-Not-Sorry&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If your email client allows it, you could always just use an image to express your out-office-sentiment, like this one. After all, they say that a picture is worth a thousand words -- and, &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;visual content is still essential to successful marketing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/32b136f.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=592&amp;amp;name=32b136f.jpg" alt="32b136f.jpg" width="592" title="32b136f.jpg" style="width: 592px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;3) The Popular Film Reference&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Are you familiar with the film &lt;em&gt;Field of Dreams&lt;/em&gt;? If not, allow us to fill you in. It centers around baseball and a family in Iowa, but saying any more might spoil the plotline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Movie synopses aside, the opening line of this out-of-office message was taken directly from the &lt;em&gt;Field of Dreams&lt;/em&gt; script -- fitting, given the sender's travels to Iowa. So before you leave, research some famous quotes about the place you're visiting. It might test the recipient's knowledge, but more likely, it'll just make them smile.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202016-11-30%20at%2011.32.32%20AM.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202016-11-30%20at%2011.32.32%20AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-11-30 at 11.32.32 AM.png" width="669" title="Screen Shot 2016-11-30 at 11.32.32 AM.png" style="width: 669px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;4) The Scavenger Hunt&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When my colleague Sam Mallikarjunan went on vacation, he set an out-of-office message that was both clever and smart. First, he sent the recipient on an imaginary scavenger hunt to "the highest peak of the tallest mountain." He used humorous absurdity to make it clear that he would not be checking email while he was away.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Plus, he incorporated a delightful technique to let people know that if they really wanted him to read their emails, they should probably send them&amp;nbsp;again after his return. Not only does that&amp;nbsp;keep the sender accountable by saying, "If this is really important, you know when to reach&amp;nbsp;me," but it also helps Mallikarjunan truly vacate his work while he's away. And that's hard to do -- And if you struggle with it, &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/vacation-guide-for-workaholics"&gt;check out these tips&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202016-11-30%20at%2011.42.46%20AM-2.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202016-11-30%20at%2011.42.46%20AM-2.png" alt="SMOOO2" width="669" title="SMOOO2" style="width: 669px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;5) The Blunt Approach&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Josh Kopelman, we salute you.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not only did Kopelman&amp;nbsp;manage to turn his out-of-office message into an epic poem of sorts, but also, he actually went through the trouble of creating a delightfully snarky, vacation-specific email address for his recipients.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Giving the option to contact an email address containing&amp;nbsp;"interruptyourvacation" provides&amp;nbsp;two things -- 1) A&amp;nbsp;dose of humor, and 2)&amp;nbsp;discouragement from actually doing what the name suggests. Plus, he prefaces it with a request for empathy, by explaining that he promised quality time to his family.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here's where honesty is a helpful device. Sure, Kopelman is truthful about the fact that he's on vacation, but he also lets the recipient know that he or she would be interrupting important family time if the first option is chosen. It states a point simply, and uses humor to avoid making it sound like he wants the reader to feel guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Josh%20Kopelman%20OOO.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=633&amp;amp;name=Josh%20Kopelman%20OOO.png" alt="Josh Kopelman OOO.png" width="633" title="Josh Kopelman OOO.png" style="width: 633px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;6) The Third Person&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When HubSpot Marketing Manager &lt;a href="http://blog.hubspot.de/marketing/author/karsten-k%C3%B6hler"&gt;Karsten KÃ¶hler&lt;/a&gt; is out of the office, he doesn't mess around. In fact, he's turned his auto-responses into a running series of commentary for fictional cartoon character &lt;a href="http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Troy_McClure"&gt;Troy McClure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Each time McClure makes an appearance in these out-of-office messages, he "speaks" on behalf of KÃ¶hler and alludes to the previous auto-responses in which he starred. It's a mild form of self-deprecating humor -- as if to say, "I know, I'm out of the office &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;" -- made only funnier by the made-up teaser title included in the last line.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As with the &lt;em&gt;Field of Dreams&lt;/em&gt; example, don't be afraid to use a pop cultural reference that audience would recognize. Instead of bemoaning your absence, they'll have something fun and familiar to laugh at.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202016-11-30%20at%203.38.35%20PM-1.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202016-11-30%20at%203.38.35%20PM-1.png" alt="Karsten OOO" width="669" title="Karsten OOO" style="width: 669px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;7) The Twitter Method&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;... and then, there was the out-of-office tweet. We're not entirely sure where&amp;nbsp;it originated, but it has two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you actually want people to be able to reach you, and you're more likely to be checking Twitter than email while out of the office, it might be an&amp;nbsp;effective way for people to reach you.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But if you tend to use social media during vacation and really do want to be left alone, we would suggest offering&amp;nbsp;a different communication method in your auto-response.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m not in the office right now but if itâ€™s important, tweet me using &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/YOUAREINTERRUPTINGMYVACATION?src=hash"&gt;#YOUAREINTERRUPTINGMYVACATION&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://t.co/SgL97nof8L"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SgL97nof8L&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; â€” Philippe Khattou (@Phil_Khattou)
        &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Phil_Khattou/status/632090644236894208"&gt;August 14, 2015&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;8) The Lack of Filter&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There seems to be a widespread belief that you're not allowed to brag in your out-of-office message. But if you ask HubSpot Marketing Director &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/author/ryan-bonnici#sm.0000e1w1nuwvbeo5sq61j1tim2kyj"&gt;Ryan Bonnici&lt;/a&gt;, who needs a filter when you've got a great vacation?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We love about this auto-response because of the marketing humor it injects with hashtags like #TMI and #SorryNotSorry. And, it's not trying to hide anything, making it clear that Bonnici is on vacation and doesn't really want to read your email while he's away. But don't worry, he says, soon you'll be on vacation, too, which will fill him with his own karmic envy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This message also pays tribute to the colleagues who are keeping matters&amp;nbsp;in order during&amp;nbsp;his absence. He specifically lists the best contact for each issue, along with a fun fact about them. Not only do I know who to ask about Field &amp;amp; Events, but I can ask for her dip recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So don't just be honest in your out-of-office -- give credit to the people who are handling things while you're gone.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202016-11-30%20at%203.58.50%20PM.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202016-11-30%20at%203.58.50%20PM.png" alt="RyanBooo" width="669" title="RyanBooo" style="width: 669px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;9) The Liquid Update&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We wish we could find the original source of this one. It's made several &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/cQc5Sb"&gt;lists&lt;/a&gt;, and its author is likely a legend within his or her network.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That said, even though we've been preaching honesty as the best policy, be careful with messages that are this transparent. Make sure you're familiar enough with your audience -- and your boss, for that matter -- to know that this sort of out-of-office message will be met with a snicker, and not with concern.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;I am currently out of the office and probably out-of-my-mind drunk. Enjoy your work week."&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;10) The Sneak Preview&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I have a confession to make. I'm writing this post on the dawn of my own vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Perhaps I had ulterior motives for seeking these examples, in that I was hoping to find inspiration for my very own out-of-office message. And if you ask me, they all have great elements that I'd like to borrow.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So, without further ado -- Sorry to have missed you.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202016-12-01%20at%208.55.34%20AM.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=605&amp;amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202016-12-01%20at%208.55.34%20AM.png" alt="AZW_OOO2" width="605" title="AZW_OOO2" style="width: 605px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Twitter Unveils Live Video: Here's What You Need to Know</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/twitter-live-video</link>
      <description>
        &lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/twitter-live-video" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/twitter-live-video-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="Twitter Unveils Live Video: Here's What You Need to Know" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On December 14th, &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2016/go-live-on-twitter"&gt;Twitter announced&lt;/a&gt; that users would be able to broadcast live video directly from Twitter on iOS and Android mobile devices. This move is the result of Twitterâ€™s integration with Periscope, the live video streaming app it &lt;a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-acquires-live-video-streaming-startup-periscope-1425938498"&gt;acquired back in March of 2015&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Earlier in 2016, Twitter &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2016/periscope-broadcasts-live-on-twitter"&gt;began featuring&lt;/a&gt; live and replayed Periscope videos in Twitter timelines that users could watch and interact with -- even without a Periscope account.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/twitter-live-video-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;name=twitter-live-video-compressor.jpg" alt="twitter-live-video" width="730" title="twitter-live-video" style="width: 730px;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On December 14th, &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2016/go-live-on-twitter"&gt;Twitter announced&lt;/a&gt; that users would be able to broadcast live video directly from Twitter on iOS and Android mobile devices. This move is the result of Twitterâ€™s integration with Periscope, the live video streaming app it &lt;a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-acquires-live-video-streaming-startup-periscope-1425938498"&gt;acquired back in March of 2015&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Earlier in 2016, Twitter &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2016/periscope-broadcasts-live-on-twitter"&gt;began featuring&lt;/a&gt; live and replayed Periscope videos in Twitter timelines that users could watch and interact with -- even without a Periscope account.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, Twitter users can broadcast live video directly from Twitter without having to create a Periscope account first.&lt;/strong&gt; Tweets featuring live video can be retweeted and liked, and videos on Twitter can generate comments and heart emojis as they do in the Periscope app.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While this isn't Twitter's first foray into live content this year -- earlier this year, Twitter began partnering with multiple organizations to become a destination site for live video, featuring &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/technology/new-twitter-app-streams-nfl-games-and-other-sports.html?_r=0"&gt;NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB Games&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/9/21/12998614/twitter-live-stream-us-presidential-debates"&gt;Presidential debates&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/07/twitter-stream-republican-democratic-conventions/"&gt;Republican and Democratic National Conventions&lt;/a&gt; -- it is an important one. With the launch of its live capability, Twitter is cementing its place in the competition for user attention -- and research shows that &lt;a href="https://research.hubspot.com/reports/the-future-of-content-marketing"&gt;video is what users want&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Letâ€™s dive into a quick explainer about how to go live on Twitter and what impact this announcement may have on video marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;How to Go Live on Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Starting a live broadcast on Twitter couldnâ€™t be easier. When you click to compose a new tweet in the mobile app, thereâ€™s now an option to record live video, as seen below:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/twitter%20live.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;name=twitter%20live.png" alt="twitter live.png" width="320" style="width: 320px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From there, you tap the "Live" option and enter a caption to accompany your video on Twitter timelines:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/twitterlivecaption.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;name=twitterlivecaption.png" alt="twitterlivecaption.png" width="320" style="width: 320px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once you start recording, it's easy to stop broadcasting, change your camera perspective, and see who's liking and interacting with your video:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/liverecordingontwitter.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;name=liverecordingontwitter.png" alt="liverecordingontwitter.png" width="320" style="width: 320px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once you've finished broadcasting, you can see how your video appears in other users' Twitter timelines. Here's my (very brief) broadcast on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;About to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoLive?src=hash"&gt;#GoLive&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter for the first time! &lt;a href="https://t.co/y3dJS6bygD"&gt;https://t.co/y3dJS6bygD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; â€” Sophia Bernazzani (@soph_bern)
        &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/soph_bern/status/810897902293745664"&gt;December 19, 2016&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That's it. Easy, right?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For now, &lt;strong&gt;Twitter users can receive notifications when specific handles they follow start recording live, and Twitter says they can expect &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2016/periscope-broadcasts-live-on-twitter"&gt;live videos&lt;/a&gt; to be featured prominently on their timelines in the future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Whatâ€™s Next for Twitter and Periscope?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Twitter Enters the Live Video Arena&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If this live video launch sounds familiar to you, you're right on target -- the live content update is very similar to &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-live-guide#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;Facebook Live&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-live-video-ephemeral-messages#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;Instagram Live&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter's new live video capabilities will help it compete against Facebook and Instagram, two social media giants that are currently &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2016/12/14/live-video-can-now-be-broadcast-directly-from-twitter/#5e71905e1066"&gt;outpacing Twitter&lt;/a&gt; in terms of &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/heres-how-many-people-are-on-facebook-instagram-twitter-other-big-social-networks/637205"&gt;user growth.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Giving Twitter users the tools to create and share their own live content could help the company attract new users and increase engagement on the platform -- especially because &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2015/new-research-twitter-users-love-to-watch-discover-and-engage-with-video"&gt;90% of Twitter&lt;/a&gt; video plays already happen on mobile devices. On Facebook, live video performs &lt;a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/03/news-feed-fyi-taking-into-account-live-video-when-ranking-feed/"&gt;3x better&lt;/a&gt; than embedded video, so Twitter users may start broadcasting more live video on Twitter if it performs similarly.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Twitter Grows as a Breaking News Source&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"Live video is really exciting for Twitter since it takes advantage of two things the network does so well -- breaking news and being human," HubSpot Social Media Marketing Manager &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chunersen"&gt;Chelsea Hunersen&lt;/a&gt; observed. And she's right: Twitter has become a destination for breaking news information, and it's easy to see why.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In just 140 characters, it's easier and faster to gather information about an evolving story than from articles or television news -- 63% of Twitter users surveyed by &lt;a href="http://www.journalism.org/2015/07/14/the-evolving-role-of-news-on-twitter-and-facebook/"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt; admitted they got their news on the platform, and 59% said they had kept up with a news event on Twitter as it was unfolding. By introducing live video into an environment already known for being fast-paced, breaking news just became even easier to share.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This integration of live video will also provide greater context for people trying to witness a breaking news event online. Hunersen added that, "this will also be a good way to disrupt the firehose weâ€™ve come to know on Twitter, where it can be hard to find quality content among the many different tweets, and will add a really engaging element to those tweets."&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Twitter Has Become a Video Destination&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Between sports and politics, Twitter was already generating &lt;a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/twitter-debate-chatter/"&gt;huge audiences&lt;/a&gt; for their live video events. Giving users the ability to broadcast live onto a popular platform is a huge win for Twitter, but it's a win for users, too. As streaming video content grows in popularity, particularly &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/12/16/cutting-cord-more-millennials-have-streaming-service-than-pay-tv/76914922/"&gt;among Millennials&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram are all competing to catch the attention of their young user bases. This live video launch could help Twitter attract more partnerships like the ones they made with professional sports leagues and cable news networks to get more eyes on video content on their platform.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Periscope's Future is Unknown&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As for Periscope, an app that boasts &lt;a href="https://medium.com/periscope/year-one-81c4c625f5bc#.l13cd6euz"&gt;110 years of live video&lt;/a&gt; per day being streamed, what's next is unclear. With the integration of Periscope's broadcasting capabilities now available on Twitter without the need for a Periscope account, we don't know whether Twitter will continue to develop the Periscope app it acquired in 2015. For now, it's business as usual, but it will be interesting to see if Periscope's numbers start dropping as Twitter users start ramping up their live video broadcasting frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We're excited to see how this launch unfolds on Twitter and how it will impact Periscope and other social media platforms. Expect more content from us about competition for users, shares, and engagement, the growing popularity of live video, and more insight into how to record a broadcast Twitter users will love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The roots of project management date back thousands of years to the creation of mega projects such as the Giza Pyramids and the Colosseum.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Although the term "project management" wasn't coined until the 1950s, projects from more than 4,500 years ago were delivered with the same systematic approach that characterizes today's projects.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The roots of project management date back thousands of years to the creation of mega projects such as the Giza Pyramids and the Colosseum.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Although the term "project management" wasn't coined until the 1950s, projects from more than 4,500 years ago were delivered with the same systematic approach that characterizes today's projects.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The introduction of the personal computer and the development of the information management sector in the 1990s revolutionized project management like never before.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Modern project management is largely dependent on &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/agency-project-management-tools"&gt;web-based project applications&lt;/a&gt;, as well as mobile applications and the cloud -- enhancing agility, mobility, and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We decided to go back in time and compare the modern project management practices to the pre-millennium standards. &lt;strong&gt;What does the evolution of project management look like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Check out the infographic below to see how things have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Snapchat Spectacles: A Simple Guide for Marketers</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/spectacles-by-snap-inc</link>
      <description>
        &lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/spectacles-by-snap-inc" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/snapchat-spectacles-compressed.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="Snapchat Spectacles: A Simple Guide for Marketers" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A great storyteller once said, â€œbrevity is the soul of wit.â€ And although William Shakespeare wasnâ€™t alive for the invention of video, we think he would agree with our marketing spin: â€œBrevity is the soul of video content.â€&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;Video content&lt;/a&gt; has exploded on social media: Videos are watched by &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2015/new-research-twitter-users-love-to-watch-discover-and-engage-with-video"&gt;82% of Twitter users&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/27/facebook-grows/"&gt;100 million hours&lt;/a&gt; of video are watched on Facebook every day.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/snapchat-spectacles-compressed.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;height=302&amp;amp;name=snapchat-spectacles-compressed.jpg" alt="snapchat-spectacles-compressed.jpg" width="730" height="302"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A great storyteller once said, â€œbrevity is the soul of wit.â€ And although William Shakespeare wasnâ€™t alive for the invention of video, we think he would agree with our marketing spin: â€œBrevity is the soul of video content.â€&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;Video content&lt;/a&gt; has exploded on social media: Videos are watched by &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2015/new-research-twitter-users-love-to-watch-discover-and-engage-with-video"&gt;82% of Twitter users&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/27/facebook-grows/"&gt;100 million hours&lt;/a&gt; of video are watched on Facebook every day.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But those platforms aren't the only ones engaging users through video: Snapchat video views jumped to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-28/snapchat-user-content-fuels-jump-to-10-billion-daily-video-views"&gt;10 billion&lt;/a&gt; per day, more than doubling in less than a year. And Snapchat users now watch nearly &lt;a href="https://gofishdigital.com/snapchat-numbers-millennials/"&gt;800 hours of video content&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;per second&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;a class="cta_button" href="https://offers.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=9f998af4-8d2c-4c67-bc1a-74305299dae6&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid="&gt; &lt;img class="hs-cta-img " style="border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; " alt="Download our free Snapchat guide to learn how to use it for your business.&amp;nbsp;" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9f998af4-8d2c-4c67-bc1a-74305299dae6.png"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In an effort to keep that growth moving forward, Snap Inc. (Snapchat's parent company) unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.spectacles.com/"&gt;Spectacles&lt;/a&gt; -- sunglasses with a built-in video camera to easily record Snaps and transfer them seamlessly to the mobile app -- in &lt;a href="https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/introducing-spectacles/"&gt;September 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Looking for the inside scoop on this launch? You're in luck, because I&amp;nbsp;just got my hands on a pair of Spectacles to experiment with for this blog post. Iâ€™ll tell you everything you need to know about Spectacles and their potential for impact on social media and content marketing -- featuring a few videos I recorded while taking them on a test run.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;What Are Spectacles?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Spectacles are sunglasses with an integrated camera that records videos and syncs with the wearerâ€™s Snapchat account via Bluetooth for easy capturing and sharing.&amp;nbsp;Check out the video below&amp;nbsp;of yours truly trying on the Spectacles for the first time (I was a little excited):&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-youtube"&gt;
        &lt;iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Y9tPwG6C1-4" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Users wear Spectacles like sunglasses and record video from their perspective in a new circular, interactive video format that lets viewers rotate their phones while viewing. As shown above, a white LED light will rotate to indicate that video is being recorded live. Check out the videos recorded using Spectacles below (and keep reading to see original footage I recorded using my Spectacles):&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/spectacles_final2.gif?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;name=spectacles_final2.gif" alt="spectacles_final2.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 320px;" width="320"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://www.spectacles.com/"&gt;Spectacles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Spectacles battery life allows for an average of 100 10-second video recordings per day, and the device can charge inside of its case several times to allow for wireless charging on-the-go. Spectacles come in black, teal, or coral and can be adjusted for &lt;a href="https://support.spectacles.com/en-US/article/specs-lenses"&gt;fit or prescription lenses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Wait, Isn't This the Same Thing as Google Glass?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Spectacles might take you back to 2012, when Google announced Google Glass -- a wearable, hands-free computer system. That &lt;a href="http://marketingland.com/google-glass-dead-google-glass-reborn-yes-114522"&gt;project was halted&lt;/a&gt; in 2015, after Google faced barriers to widespread adoption, including privacy concerns and &lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/5900970/jon-stewart-takes-on-google-glasses-and-instagram-in-two-for-one-mockery"&gt;pop culture mockery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Luckily, Snapchat Inc. seems to be following a different playbook when it comes to the positioning of Spectacles. Most notably, the product is dedicated solely to video capturing instead of functioning as a wearable computer system like Google Glass. As a result, the cost is significantly less: Spectacles can be purchased for just $129.99.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sure, the specs are certainly a bit silly looking -- the large lenses, bold frames, etc. -- but, at the very least, they align with the brand's colorful image.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/snapchat%20selfie_SB.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;name=snapchat%20selfie_SB.jpg" alt="snapchat selfie_SB.jpg" width="320" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 320px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, they're far more wearable than Glass, which received plenty of &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/01/02/google_glass_but_it_looks_good_why_not.html"&gt;less than positive feedback&lt;/a&gt; in terms of the design.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;How to Get Spectacles&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you're chomping at the bit to get your hands on a pair, we've got some bad news: Spectacles arenâ€™t sold at a traditional storefront. Instead, theyâ€™re available in limited quantity for $129.99 at Snapbot vending machines that spontaneously pop up around the country. Yes, that's right, &lt;em&gt;a Snapbot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/BotBlink_v3-877852825.gif?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=426&amp;amp;name=BotBlink_v3-877852825.gif" alt="BotBlink_v3-877852825.gif" width="300" height="426" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt; Source:&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt; &lt;a href="https://support.spectacles.com/en-US/article/about-snapbot"&gt;Spectacles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pretty interesting concept, right?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now there's a lot to be said about this unorthodox strategy, as Snap Inc. is disrupting both how video is recorded&lt;em&gt; and&lt;/em&gt; how new technology brought to market.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Instead of shopping online or heading to a store, these Snapbots are being dropped without announcement or fanfare. Instead, buyers find out about &lt;a href="https://www.spectacles.com/map/"&gt;Snapbot&lt;/a&gt; sightings via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snapbotsighting"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/snapbotsightings/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, and word-of-mouth, then rush to queue in line in hopes that the Spectacles arenâ€™t sold out by the time itâ€™s their turn. Additionally, if youâ€™re near a Snapbot, a Geofilter will appear in Snapchat letting you know:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If you visit the â€œFind a Botâ€ page now, youâ€™ll either see a map to the current location of the vending machine, or this image:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://www.spectacles.com/map/"&gt;Spectacles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The strategy behind this interesting distribution method? Aside from the obvious appeal to exclusivity, "Itâ€™s about us figuring out if it fits into peopleâ€™s lives and seeing how they like it,â€ Snapchat's CEO &lt;a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/snapchat-releases-first-hardware-product-spectacles-1474682719"&gt;Evan Spiegel told the Wall Street Journal.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Spectacles are currently being resold for hundreds, and sometimes thousands of dollars on sites like &lt;a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;amp;_trksid=p2141725.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xsnapchat+spectacles.TRS0&amp;amp;_nkw=snapchat+spectacles&amp;amp;_sacat=0"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(admittedly, that's where we snagged ours) and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_7_10?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;amp;field-keywords=snapchat+spectacles&amp;amp;sprefix=spectacles%2Caps%2C216&amp;amp;crid=UEI5MTR1I0V6"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the rest of us to wonder whether or not this approach errs more on the side of frustrating or brilliant. But if there's one thing we know, it's that the buzz -- both positive and negative -- around this launch has inevitably created an interesting sounding board for ideas and iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Why Are Spectacles Such a Big Deal?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Between the unusual launch and the unique video perspective, it's easy to understand why Spectacles have the tech industry talking. But what does the introduction of a product like this mean for marketers? How might this launch shape the way brands approach their go-to-market strategies in the future? What impact will this have on the Snapchat app?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Let's walk through some of the biggest takeaways here.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;A New Way to Watch and Record Video&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Have you ever had a moment that you wished you had captured on video, but you didnâ€™t have the time to grab your phone, open your camera up, and delete enough photos to make room for storage?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Spectacles allow for (almost) hands-free video recording, granting wearers the freedom to record from their point of view. This adds a new level of ease for the â€œvideographerâ€ to live stream an event, go behind-the-scenes, record a how-to video, or even interview someone. It also creates a new, interesting experience for the viewer: Imagine watching a video from the eyes of your favorite brand or personality.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of Snaps I recorded hands-free using Spectacles:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-youtube"&gt;
        &lt;iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3TWluIg1B58" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The camera utilizes &lt;a href="https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/introducing-spectacles/"&gt;circular video&lt;/a&gt;, which plays full screen on any device, in any orientation. And the lens is designed to capture the human perspective, offering a 115 degree field of view. This opens Snapchat to a variety of new video content: Previously, users had to record Snaps in &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/heres-what-snap-incs-spectacles-could-mean-brands-and-creators-173728"&gt;vertical format&lt;/a&gt;, and the display wouldnâ€™t auto-adjust if videos were recorded horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here's a (very meta) video of me watching my Snapchat Story and experimenting with the circular video format -- recorded using Spectacles, of course:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-youtube"&gt;
        &lt;iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/K0ZPLNveRu8" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;nbsp;had fun&amp;nbsp;experimenting with the Spectacles for this article, and I'm excited to keep using them to record unique video content. I&amp;nbsp;especially love the battery-charging case that keeps the Spectacles safe and ready to record at a moment's notice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;A Unique Distribution Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If youâ€™re a social media marketer, take note: Snap Inc. does a great job of turning its product into a &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/viral-video-great-dane#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;viral&lt;/a&gt; social media moment. The secrecy and exclusivity involved in the rollout make Snapchat users excited and curious -- &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/make-fomo-work-for-your-ecommerce-company#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;FOMO is real&lt;/a&gt;, people.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The larger lesson for marketers here? Use secrecy and exclusivity to generate buzz and make your audience more interested than ever in what youâ€™re up to. For Snapchat Inc., that meant introducing wearable technology vending machines. For your company, that might mean serving up limited-time offers or creating an exclusive ambassador program.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;A Platform-Specific Video Format&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s still too early to analyze how Spectacles will perform, but broadly, Spectacles could impact social media and video marketing in few big ways.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Consumers want more video content, &lt;a href="https://research.hubspot.com/reports/the-future-of-content-marketing"&gt;especially on social media&lt;/a&gt;. Spectacles answered that call by creating a new video recording format that can &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/heres-what-snap-incs-spectacles-could-mean-brands-and-creators-173728"&gt;only be viewed on Snapchat&lt;/a&gt;. Spectacles are effectively helping create more video content on Snapchat while increasing their user baseâ€™s engagement with their mobile app. (In 2016, four-year-old Snapchat overtook ten-year-old Twitterâ€™s user base with &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-02/snapchat-passes-twitter-in-daily-usage"&gt;150 million&lt;/a&gt; daily active users.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From a brand perspective, this could make Snapchat a more desirable channel for advertising, as shoppers are &lt;a href="https://animoto.com/blog/business/small-business-video-infographic/"&gt;nearly twice as likely&lt;/a&gt; to purchase a product if theyâ€™ve seen a video first. (Think: Showcasing your product through the lens of an authentic, human perspective.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Additionally, if youâ€™re an event marketer, this new video format offers an interesting avenue for showcasing what it's like to actually be in attendance -- something that regular video content or photos can't capture.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;What's Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We canâ€™t tell you much more about data on the Spectacles ... yet. But we'll be sure to keep you in the loop with more circular videos on &lt;a href="https://www.snapchat.com/add/hubspotinc"&gt;our Snapchat Story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>4 of the Biggest Advertising Trends of 2016</title>

        &lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/biggest-advertising-trends-2016" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/00-Blog_Thinkstock_Images/ad-trends-2016.png?t=1483790613555" alt="4 of the Biggest Advertising Trends of 2016" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;2016 was a year of unprecedented creative opportunities for advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Advancements in technology enabled agencies to develop campaigns across innovative new mediums, pushing the boundaries of digital advertising and inviting consumers to experience brands like never before.&lt;/p&gt;
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/00-Blog_Thinkstock_Images/ad-trends-2016.png?t=1483790613555"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;2016 was a year of unprecedented creative opportunities for advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Advancements in technology enabled agencies to develop campaigns across innovative new mediums, pushing the boundaries of digital advertising and inviting consumers to experience brands like never before.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before we see what 2017 has in store, let's take a look back at some of this year's most impactful advertising trends. The following four marketing tactics left a big mark on 2016, and they show no signs of slowing down as we head into the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;See which trends fueled some of the most creative ad campaigns, and&amp;nbsp;start planning your first 2017 campaign.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;4 of the Biggest Advertising Trends of 2016&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1) Experiential Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/creative-pop-up-events"&gt;branded pop-up shops&lt;/a&gt; to larger &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-experiential-marketing-campaigns"&gt;promotional events&lt;/a&gt;, brands definitely embraced experiential marketing in 2016. And agencies rose to meet this growing demand.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Big brands like &lt;a href="http://www.setcreative.com/work/sprite-brand-experience"&gt;Coca-Cola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.thesayok.com/google-play-music-wanderlust-108/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/video/advertising-branding/how-budweiser-garage-brewed-immersive-experience-sxsw-attendees-video-170177"&gt;Anheuser-Busch&lt;/a&gt; sought out agency partners who&amp;nbsp;specialize in creating brand experiences that woo participants and generate buzz on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what makes experiential marketing so powerful?&lt;/strong&gt; Casey Conway, a founding partner of &lt;a href="http://www.thesayok.com/"&gt;Say OK&lt;/a&gt; -- the agency behind experiential work for brands like Google, Microsoft, and Converse -- says&amp;nbsp;it helps brands relate to people who don't typically connect with traditional advertising mediums.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"We pride ourselves on getting those people who think they know better, who can see right through the traditional side [of advertising], and hit them in a cool, unique way," Conway &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/experiential-marketing-shop-creates-immersive-work-people-who-hate-advertising-170262"&gt;said to Adweek&lt;/a&gt;. "It's not about a brand just being the logo [in an immersive experience]; it's about giving the consumer an awesome experience from a brand."&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Example: SXSW 'Suicide Squad' Tattoo Shop Pop-Up&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Warner Brothers wanted a unique way to promote the &lt;i&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/i&gt; movie at SXSW, they turned to the experiential ad experts at Milwaukee-based &lt;a href="https://gmrmarketing.com/en-us/the-work/warner-bros-suicide-squad-sxsw-2016/"&gt;GMR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Their team temporarily converted a tattoo shop in downtown Austin into &lt;i&gt;Harley Quinn's Tattoo Parlor&lt;/i&gt;, offering free temporary and permanent tattoos inspired by the film's characters to anyone who was interested. The shop was redesigned with decor from the movie and staffed with a team of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn"&gt;Harley Quinn&lt;/a&gt; lookalikes to draw people in.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The event was a massive success for Warner Brothers, drawing in over &lt;a href="https://gmrmarketing.com/en-us/the-work/warner-bros-suicide-squad-sxsw-2016/"&gt;2,400 SXSW attendees&lt;/a&gt; and generating &lt;a href="https://gmrmarketing.com/en-us/the-work/warner-bros-suicide-squad-sxsw-2016/"&gt;35.4 million impressions&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;2) Virtual Reality&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Virtual and augmented reality have been rapidly gaining momentum for a few years, with investments in the space topping &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/07/investments-in-vrar-have-already-hit-1-1-billion-in-2016/"&gt;$1.1 billion in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Skeptics have &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/brands-love-virtual-realitys-potential-want-medium-become-more-accessible-170174"&gt;expressed concerns&lt;/a&gt; as to whether or not the tech is accessible enough to generate widespread and sustainable consumer interest, but this year &lt;strong&gt;advertisers began to realize that people are generally enthusiastic about exploring the new medium.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/nielsen-says-mainstream-consumers-really-are-interested-virtual-reality-173665"&gt;survey conducted by Nielsen's Media lab&lt;/a&gt; found that 24% of consumers said they will likely use or purchase VR next year, and another 20% said they would try it after learning some of the basics of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Companies like &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/north-face-gave-these-shoppers-vr-experience-suddenly-got-awesomely-real-167900"&gt;North Face&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/samsung-and-viceland-debut-virtual-reality-trailer-their-documentary-about-syria-174854"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/olympics-may-give-virtual-reality-its-long-anticipated-close-172855"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; all got in on the action, and smaller VR-focused marketing startups began &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/how-ad-tech-companies-are-testing-new-formats-virtual-reality-and-360-video-173325"&gt;cropping up to meet demand from major brands&lt;/a&gt;. In a signal of commitment to the medium, The New York Times even purchased &lt;a href="http://fakelove.tv/"&gt;Fake Love&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based agency specializing in VR and AR campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"It's completely immersive," said Adam Harter, VP&amp;nbsp;of marketing and cultural connections at Pepsi, &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/will-virtual-reality-experiences-brands-rival-super-bowl-ads-174105"&gt;speaking at a video conference&lt;/a&gt;. "We believe that if you can create an emotional connection with the consumer, you will hook them, you will make them fans of your brand. And I don't think that any other experience other than VR can create an experience that people want to share more."&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Example: The National Park Service's "Through the Ages" short film&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To celebrate the National Park Service's centennial anniversary, National Geographic partnered with Facebook's Oculus Team and VR production agency &lt;a href="https://www.felixandpaul.com/?info"&gt;Felix &amp;amp; Paul Studios&lt;/a&gt; to create a short film highlighting the natural beauty of Yosemite National Park.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Starring President Obama and his family, the 11-minute VR film offers viewers a uniquely immersive glimpse at the park as the first family explores the landscape. The video is available for Oculus Rift and on Facebook's 360-degree video platform.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You can watch the 360-degree video version &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/08/25/watch-join-president-obama-virtual-reality-tour-yosemite"&gt;on the White House website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/yosemite-01.jpg?t=1483790613555" class="alignCenter shadow"&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;3) Live Video&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;2016 was the year of live video for social platforms. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10102764095821611"&gt;launched Live&lt;/a&gt; back in April, Twitter &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2016/12/14/live-video-can-now-be-broadcast-directly-from-twitter/#6c01bf210665"&gt;introduced a mobile integration&lt;/a&gt; with live-streaming app Periscope, and Instagram &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/instagram-just-rolled-out-its-live-video-feature-all-us-users-175076"&gt;just released&lt;/a&gt; a live video streaming service to all U.S. users in December.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Live video has become an inclusive extension of video marketing, allowing users to connect with content in real time. Brands have been &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-live-guide"&gt;taking full advantage of the new streaming capabilities&lt;/a&gt;, inviting consumers to experience live branded content directly from their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And consumers are eager to tune in. Retail giant Lowe's &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/social-platforms-and-brands-turn-live-video-will-viewers-keep-tuning-174876"&gt;unveiled their Black Friday offers&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook Live to an audience of 32,000 (and picked up an additional 891,000 views via promoted posts over the following days).&amp;nbsp;Martha Stewart broadcasts a series of popular &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/martha-stewart-best-facebook-live-2016-6"&gt;live cooking videos&lt;/a&gt;, and Refinery29 &lt;a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/refinery29-building-10-person-facebook-live-team/"&gt;hired a team of 10 staffers&lt;/a&gt; just to focus on creating Facebook Live content for the lifestyle website.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"Live content is uniquely compelling when it offers rarity," said Topher Burns, group director of product innovation at Deep Focus, &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/social-platforms-and-brands-turn-live-video-will-viewers-keep-tuning-174876"&gt;to Adweek&lt;/a&gt;. "Glimpses of life you'd never usually get, spaces you'd normally be denied access to, things that are happening in one moment that you've just got to see."&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Example: Taco Bell's Friendsgiving Feast&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To celebrate Thanksgiving this year, fast food chain Taco Bell held a "Friendsgiving" feast, inviting a group of social media influencers to their headquarters for a &lt;a href="http://www.brandeating.com/2014/11/a-look-at-taco-bells-2nd-annual-friendsgiving-feast.html"&gt;unusual spread&lt;/a&gt; of Thanksgiving-inspired taco creations.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They streamed the whole dinner live on Facebook, attracting an impressive audience of &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/social-platforms-and-brands-turn-live-video-will-viewers-keep-tuning-174876"&gt;150,000 taco-loving consumers&lt;/a&gt; throughout the broadcast.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/taco-bell.jpg?t=1483790613555" class="alignCenter shadow"&gt;Image Credit:
        &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tacobell/status/799458443916513281"&gt;Taco Bell's Twitter&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;4) Influencer Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"Influencer marketing" became a much-circulated buzzword in 2016, but it's still a largely &lt;a href="http://digiday.com/brands/inside-rocky-love-hate-relationship-marketers-influencers/"&gt;uncertain investment&lt;/a&gt; for brands and agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The concept of influencer marketing is pretty straightforward: to reach new audiences on social media, brands pay "influencers" -- social media personalities and celebrities with massive follower counts -- to post about their products. It's become an extremely prevalent practice (particularly on YouTube and Instagram, where &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/animal-influencers"&gt;even pets are getting in on it&lt;/a&gt;), but there still aren't clear compensation guidelines for influencers or ways for brands to measure the success of influencer-driven efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And there's been some legal backlash. TruthinAdvertising.org, a nonprofit devoted to fighting deceptive advertising, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/business/media/instagram-ads-marketing-kardashian.html"&gt;called out the Kardashian sisters in August&lt;/a&gt; for not being transparent about what brands they were being paid to promote on Instagram. As a result, many sponsored posts now include #ad or some variation to indicate that a post is a paid endorsement, but brands complain it &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/business/media/instagram-ads-marketing-kardashian.html"&gt;reduces the efficacy&lt;/a&gt; of the posts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Despite some of the issues with the practice, many brands have found success with tapping influencers to promote their products and target niche audiences. Lifestyle brands have been &lt;a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/5-brands-on-instagram-that-succeed-with-influencer-marketing/"&gt;particularly successful&lt;/a&gt; reaching consumers through influencer campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Example: Honest Tea&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Honest Tea, a beverage company, &lt;a href="http://digiday.com/brands/yass-queen-honest-tea-uses-influencers-buzzfeed-reach-young-moms/"&gt;regularly partners with social media influencers&lt;/a&gt; to reach their target audience: young mothers. The brand has selectively recruited seven Instagram-famous moms to share challenging parenting moments with the hashtag #RefreshinglyHonest.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);"&gt;
        &lt;div style="padding: 8px;"&gt;
        &lt;div style="background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50.0% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;"&gt;
        &amp;nbsp;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BHTM8eKgtif/" style="color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;"&gt;She isn't even two but Evangeline has very particular tastes in food. Basically, anything sweet or salty and she's all over it (sounds familiar...). Most days I try (beg) her to eat balanced meals, and other days I let her have her way. Today is one of those days. #OlivesForever Posted in partnership with @HonestTea-share some of your #RefreshinglyHonest moments so we can all feel better about our less than perfect parenting moments &amp;lt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"&gt;A photo posted by Jessica Shyba (@mommasgonecity) on Jun 30, 2016 at 6:14pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/3-steps-to-grow-a-successful-live-chat-program" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/live-chat-laptop.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="live-chat-laptop.jpg" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;â€œWe got a $300,000 opportunity this week from live chat on our site.â€&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m filled with pride as I hear our VP of sales make this statement. I worked hard for six months to get the sales team invested in live chat as a sales channel and Iâ€™m finally seeing the results.&lt;/p&gt;
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/live-chat-laptop.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;height=302&amp;amp;name=live-chat-laptop.jpg" alt="live-chat-laptop.jpg" width="730" height="302"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;â€œWe got a $300,000 opportunity this week from live chat on our site.â€&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m filled with pride as I hear our VP of sales make this statement. I worked hard for six months to get the sales team invested in live chat as a sales channel and Iâ€™m finally seeing the results.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It wasnâ€™t easy, though. For many weeks, I sat in meetings or sent detailed reports trying to explain that while we had dozens of leads coming in through live chat, they weren't being followed up on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;I sadly watched the leadsâ€™ value diminish the longer they sat in the database. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;But now that the sales team members were committed, live chat was proving to be a lucrative channel. I had members of the sales team asking me every week to add them as agents. They wanted in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;They wanted in, because the most valuable leads are those that are on your website.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;People visiting your website are there looking for something. If you can provide them with the answer they are seeking, you are going to win their favor. Thatâ€™s where live chat comes in. The ability to connect directly with your visitor, at the moment they have questions about your product is an incredible driver of marketing-qualified leads and sales.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, you only get out of live chat, what you put in:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Itâ€™s difficult to realize the kind of results above without joint investment from your marketing and sales organizations. So, how do you get everyone involved? Below are the steps to getting leadership, sales, and marketing, on the live chat train.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;1) Get People On Board With Live Chat&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Identify an Owner and Then Determine the Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You need a live chat champion. The champion will most likely live in the marketing team. Once this person is identified, itâ€™s critical that they set expectations with leadership, the marketing team, and the sales team regarding what live chat will accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It depends on the stage and structure of your business, but there is a likely a gap that live chat will fill. Define your initial expectations for the benefits that chat will provide. Here are a few suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Improved understanding of site effectiveness&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Better insight on site visitors&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Increased site conversion rate&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Increased # of leads&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Increased # of MQLs&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;More sales opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Choose one of these improvements as a goal and make it your focus for the roll out and testing of live chat. Then, set a specific amount of time and an approach to your test. At the end of that period, measure your results.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Test It Out&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Get started with a trial. Most live chat providers have a trial and &lt;a href="https://snapengage.com/?utm_source=hubspot&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=inbound"&gt;SnapEngage&lt;/a&gt; offers a 15-Day Free Trial. It's incredibly easy to setup. The setup typically just requires adding a snippet of code to your website. Once you're up and running, you can start to validate the improvements you've defined almost instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As you conduct your test, there are a few ways to know if live chat is working:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;You are chatting daily with your site visitors and chat volume is increasing&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The bounce rate on the pages where chat is installed is decreasing&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Marketing is driving conversions from visitor to lead through live chat&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;You learned something from your chat conversations about your market or how to improve your website&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Your sales team closed a deal with a lead that came through live chat&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The chat agents are consistently using the tool&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Illustrate the Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After you have conducted your test, report your findings and the improvements you experienced to the sales and marketing team. Then, project those improvements out over a longer period of time to provide a full picture of what the future with live chat might look like.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, people who use live chat as an acquisition and conversion channel often find it to be one of the most successful drivers of leads in regards to volume and quality. Weâ€™ve seen that clients who use chat, experience a 10-20% increase in conversion from visitor to lead. If you experience an increase in your site conversion rate of 10%, show the impact of that over time.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hereâ€™s an example:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;table style="height: 667px;" width="624"&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td style="width: 281px;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td style="width: 185px;"&gt; &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without Live Chat &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td style="width: 157px;"&gt; &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With Live Chat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td style="width: 281px;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Site Visitors/Mo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td style="width: 185px; text-align: right;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;10,000&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td style="width: 157px; text-align: right;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;10,000&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td style="width: 281px;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conversion Rate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td style="width: 185px; text-align: right;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;10%&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td style="width: 157px; text-align: right;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;20%&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;

        &lt;td style="width: 281px;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;# of Leads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td style="width: 185px; text-align: right;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;1000&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td style="width: 157px; text-align: right;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;2000&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;

        &lt;td style="width: 281px;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualification Rate*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td style="width: 185px; text-align: right;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;36%&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td style="width: 157px; text-align: right;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;36%&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;

        &lt;td style="width: 185px; text-align: right;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;27%&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td style="width: 157px; text-align: right;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;27%&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;

        &lt;td style="width: 157px; text-align: right;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;194&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;

        &lt;td style="width: 281px;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ave. Revenue/Customer/Yr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;

        &lt;td style="width: 157px; text-align: right;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;$1000&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;

        &lt;td style="width: 185px; text-align: right;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;$97,000&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td style="width: 157px; text-align: right;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;$194,000&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px;"&gt;*&lt;a href="http://blog.capterra.com/average-b2b-conversion-rate/"&gt;http://blog.capterra.com/average-b2b-conversion-rate/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thatâ€™s a huge increase in revenue opportunity--nearly $100K per year--just by improving the conversion rate with live chat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you can illustrate these kinds of benefits to sales and marketing leadership, they will be pumped.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If youâ€™re looking for more information to present to your sales and marketing leadership on live chatâ€™s ability to bridge the gap between marketing and sales, you can also read our guide, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://info.snapengage.com/live-chat-inbound-marketing-strategy"&gt;How to Leverage Live Chat to Get More Out of Inbound Marketing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;2) Implement Successfully&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Define ownership and accountability&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For chat to be a successful channel for your business, accountability needs to be clear. Most importantly, there should be committed chat agents who will respond to inbound chats. Without that, chat provides no value.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here is the most common accountability structure we see marketing and sales teams use when it comes to live chat:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketing or Marketing Operations&lt;/strong&gt;: Frequently, marketing is the cheerleader of chat. In this role, they are commonly responsible for implementing, training, and measurement.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead or Business Development Reps (LDR/BDR)&lt;/strong&gt;: These are the committed chat agents. This team is responsible for managing the inbound chats, qualifying them, and then handing them off to sales.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales Account Execs&lt;/strong&gt;: Once the leads have been qualified and passed along, sales is responsible for the following up right away and moving qualified leads through the sales process.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For companies with existing LDR/BDR teams, chat is a no-brainer. It provides the entry-level employees with a less intimidating way to interact with prospects and the opportunity to get familiar with the product and frequently asked questions they might encounter, but in a controlled environment, which prepares them for the phones.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For companies without an existing front line for sales, you can enlist sales reps, marketers, or office admins.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Another option is to do what SnapEngage does and make everyone responsible for chat. This approach provides an incredible inside view on the market, the questions prospects are asking, how people are navigating the website, and the first impression of the site and product.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Install Properly&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customize the design of your live chat tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Having all the design elements on your site working in harmony helps to present a unified structure and visual appeal. It has also been shown to help drive engagement. Make sure that live chat aligns with your existing web presence and brand style guide.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Place chat on the most qualified pages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s possible to choose where your live chat panel appears and where it doesnâ€™t. Taking a strategic approach to where you place live chat on your website will help gradually introduce your team to live chat and also help focus resources on your most qualified leads."&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Instead of installing across the entire website, install chat on only your most qualified pages. These are the pages that people who are further down the funnel are visiting, such as the product page, the pricing page, schedule a demo, or start a trial areas of your website.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Make it personal&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Add names and pictures of your agents to make the experience more personal. Itâ€™s important to provide a human touch. By adding pictures and names, you establish credibility, which improves the likelihood of conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Train Your Agents&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It may sound obvious, but itâ€™s important that you familiarize your chat agents with all of the features and settings. You can expect that live chat tools will have a general guide to chat. But beyond the general overview, itâ€™s useful to find the unique tools that are going to create efficiency and collaboration for your team. Most live chat tools have features such as:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Keyboard shortcuts to help make chatting more efficient&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Canned responses to ensure that your chat agents are leveraging existing marketing content to answer common questions&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Territory (or other) assignments and chat transfers to send chats to the proper team member &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Integrate with your CRM&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Much of the power of chat for marketing and sales comes with integration. SnapEngage integrates with several marketing and sales software providers, like HubSpot. These integrations allow you to store all of your prospect and customer communication history, including chat activities, in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It also provides the seamlessness of assigning leads to the proper team members and the ability for those team members to see a history of lead interactions (including detailed transcripts), so you always know whatâ€™s been said. Itâ€™s also possible to include chat activity as a lead scoring criteria to support your lead qualification process.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;3) Measure and Improve&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Continual measurement and improvement is critical to the success of a live chat program. As you roll out the program, be sure to define accountability and set up a scorecard to measure performance on a regular cadence.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Each group and individual should have a clear understanding of who is accountable for what. Again, the most basic action that the group needs to be accountable to is responding to chats. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Also determine who will own measurement. When it comes to measuring how successful live chat is, you can start at a high level and look at volume and quality.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;# of chats&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;% of visitor to chat&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;# of leads (from chat source)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;% of chat to lead&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you want to go a bit deeper, you can follow your chat activity down the funnel and track a few sales-related metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;# of sales opportunities (from chat source)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;% of lead to opportunity&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;$ in pipeline (from chat source)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;# of closed sales (from chat source)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;$ in sales (from chat source)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Other, more specific things to monitor and measure are chat performance by different criteria such as:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Site page&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Visitor geography&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Chat agent&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Product&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Etc.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You can derive a ton of valuable data about the effectiveness of live chat that will only help you optimize and improve your marketing and sales performance. Itâ€™s important to recognize that a live chat program isnâ€™t a â€œset it and forget itâ€ program.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Continual improvements can make a huge difference and will continue the interest and investment in live chat as a marketing and sales channel.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a class="cta_button" href="https://offers.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=535c7d6f-ba24-4eed-8511-563907b87406&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid="&gt; &lt;img class="hs-cta-img " style="border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; " alt="New Call-to-action" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/535c7d6f-ba24-4eed-8511-563907b87406.png"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/productive-holiday-ideas" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/how-to-be-productive-holidays.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="20 Productive Things to Do During Your Downtime" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Work and a busy schedule can take a lot out of a person. Thankfully, vacation is&amp;nbsp;a great time to slow down, recharge, spend time seeing your loved ones, and do things you wouldn't normally have time to do.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While it can be tempting to fill your out-of-office&amp;nbsp;schedule with travel and funtivities, there is something to be said about making time to tackle some of the things that have been collecting dust in your mental backlog.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Work and a busy schedule can take a lot out of a person. Thankfully, vacation is&amp;nbsp;a great time to slow down, recharge, spend time seeing your loved ones, and do things you wouldn't normally have time to do.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While it can be tempting to fill your out-of-office&amp;nbsp;schedule with travel and funtivities, there is something to be said about making time to tackle some of the things that have been collecting dust in your mental backlog.&lt;a class="cta_button" href="https://offers.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=be08853d-7ccb-4ab6-ba13-ef66a1d9b4ff&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid="&gt; &lt;img class="hs-cta-img " style="border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; " alt="Download our complete guide here for more tips on improving your productivity." src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/be08853d-7ccb-4ab6-ba13-ef66a1d9b4ff.png"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;To help you get ahead for the upcoming year, we've put together a list of 20 ideas for productive things to do during your downtime while on vacation. Once you've picked your favorites, &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-to-do-list-apps-tools"&gt;try using one of these awesome to-do list tools&lt;/a&gt; to keep yourself on course.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;20 Productive Things to Do During Your Downtime&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1) Play around with new technology.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There's never a good time to learn how to Snapchat when you've got a billion other things going on, but learning those new technologies is important. For example, &lt;strong&gt;Snapchat gets 10 billion video views per day,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-28/snapchat-user-content-fuels-jump-to-10-billion-daily-video-views"&gt;according to a Bloomberg report&lt;/a&gt;. That's more than Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So why not use your downtime over the holidays to download and play around with some of these new technologies? A few that we recommend include Snapchat, Instagram (&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-stories-guide"&gt;read this post&lt;/a&gt; for some great Instagram Story tips), &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/advertisers-guide-mobile-messaging-apps#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;messaging apps&lt;/a&gt; like Slack and WhatsApp, and &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/photo-video-editing-apps-mobile"&gt;photo editing apps&lt;/a&gt; to improve your content creation skills.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;2) Write thank-you notes.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Take advantage of the opportunity to make someone's day by writing them a meaningful, personal thank-you note. It's a way to distinguish yourself in our increasingly informal, digital world.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thank-you notes are an easy way to show your appreciation, but there are two roadblocks that cause people to not do it: They don't have thank-you cards or they don't know what to write. Let us help out:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Buy blank or thank-you notes in bulk. It's as easy as searching "thank-you cards" on Amazon and buying your favorite pack. (Don't forget to stock up on stamps, too!) Or, you could go digital using the &lt;a href="https://sincerely.com/postagram"&gt;Postagram app&lt;/a&gt; for iPhone: It lets you type up a quick thank-you note to someone, snap a photo, and then they receive an actual, physical card.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://ideas.hallmark.com/thank-you-ideas/how-to-write-a-thank-you-note/"&gt;Here's a thank-you note template from Hallmark&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;3) Schedule all your appointments.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Go see your doctor, your dentist, and your barber or hair stylist. Take your pet to the vet for a check-up. Get the oil changed in your car. Think of all those minor inconveniences you just can't seem to get to when you're on your regular schedule, and check them off the list. (Or at least schedule them for the future.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;4) Make reservations for future plans and trips.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whether you have a whole trip coming up or even just a dinner, spend some time doing the thoughtful research you may not otherwise have time to do -- and make reservations as far in advance as possible. These things can end up sneaking up on you, so making plans early helps guarantee you won't lose out on some cool opportunities. Not to mention, it'll leave you feeling less stressed out down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;5) Get your planner or calendar organized for the new year.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Did you get a new planner or calendar for the upcoming year? The holidays are a perfect time to fill it out with the appointments and trips you've already planned. When you're not spending time on everyday work tasks, you can experiment with &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/organize-to-do-list#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;new organizational formats&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;such as the bullet journal to make sure you're as productive as possible when you head back to the office.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;6) Talk to your friends and family about what you do.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While you should take advantage of the time you have away from work to dial back and focus on other parts of your life, you don't need to remove work from your mind completely. Talking about what you do with the people you love is different from actually &lt;em&gt;doing &lt;/em&gt;it. Work is such an important part of our lives and takes up a huge chunk of our waking hours, so sometimes sharing that with family and friends can actually be a bonding exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If your friends and family aren't familiar with what you do or are interested in learning more, now's a great time to fill them in on what you do all day, why you like it (or don't like it), and what you're hoping to do in the future. Who knows, you could pick up some great insights from people who are removed from your day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;(Inbound marketers, feel free to steal some ideas from&amp;nbsp;"&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/explain-inbound-marketing-ht"&gt;5 Ways to Explain Inbound Marketing to Your Family&lt;/a&gt;.")&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;7) Call your long-distance friends.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You know that list of friends and family members you've been meaning to catch up with, but never seem to find the time? Open your phone, find a comfortable spot to sit, and give them a call with your full attention. Now's the perfect time to connect with people you don't see regularly but want to stay in touch with.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;8) Start building a habit.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some say it takes &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-clear/forming-new-habits_b_5104807.html"&gt;21 days to build a habit&lt;/a&gt;. Others say it takes a lot longer. But exactly how long it takes doesn't really matter. The point is, you have to put the work in up front if you want a &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/habit-research-ted-talks#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;habit&lt;/a&gt; to stick. So why not use the holidays to get started?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whether you want to start flossing every day or writing in a journal before bed each night, take the time during your downtime to &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/science-productivity"&gt;start habit-forming&lt;/a&gt; and set yourself up for success.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;9) Learn a new skill for your job.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Most people have a skill they've always wanted to learn to advance their career, but simply haven't gotten around to.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ever wanted to learn basic coding? &lt;a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web"&gt;Codecademy's HTML/CSS courses&lt;/a&gt; can be finished over the course of a holiday without interrupting family time. Many&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://academy.hubspot.com/certification"&gt;HubSpot Academy&lt;/a&gt; certifications are free and take only a few hours to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ever wanted to learn your way around Photoshop? Start by following along with a beginner's tutorial &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34010/How-to-Use-Photoshop-The-Ultimate-Guide-for-the-Design-Impaired-Marketer.aspx"&gt;like the one in this blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Unsure how to make anything besides a spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel? Experiment with some Excel &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/learn-excel-resources"&gt;resources in this blog post&lt;/a&gt;. (And if you're a marketer who's not sure where to start, &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-skills-handbook"&gt;here's a free ebook that analyzes today's most in-demand marketing skills&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you really don't have the time to dig into a new skill, you can at least use the time to set yourself up for starting to learn one in the new year. Spend some time browsing conferences or classes you could take and figuring out where you can fit them into your schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;10) Learn a new skill &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;for your job.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Skills that aren't related to your job are usually even more fun to learn. What about learning how to paint art to decorate your home? Taking a new type of workout class? Learning a new language with an app &lt;a href="https://www.duolingo.com/"&gt;like Duolingo&lt;/a&gt; -- perhaps for a country you'll be traveling to this year?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Try to pick something that uses parts of your brain that you don't usually tap into during the workday. It can do wonders for your happiness, creativity, and wellbeing -- and hey, you may even find a new passion or meet people who end up making a huge impact on your life.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;11) Catch up on reading.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here's a classic but essential vacation tip: Catch up on those books or articles you've been wanting to get to so badly. It's really hard to find time to read when you're busy with work, but now that you're on vacation, you can cuddle up with a blanket and a book. If you're looking for suggestions, &lt;a href="http://trackmaven.com/blog/2016/08/51-must-read-marketing-books"&gt;check out this list of must-read marketing books from TrackMaven&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;12) Listen to podcasts.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Podcasts serve as an amazing way to pass the time on planes, trains, and automobiles during the heavy travel season. The key is picking and downloading what you want to listen to &lt;em&gt;before &lt;/em&gt;you go on the trip, when you have WiFi. That way, you're not draining your battery and data while on the move.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We recommend a good mix of genres: business, comedy, true crime, etc. Here are two lists of exceptional podcasts we've put together in the past year: "&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/podcasts-social-media#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;Want to be a Better Social Media Marketer? Listen to These 10 Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-podcasts-for-management#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;10 of the Best Podcasts About Business and Management&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;13) Organize your inbox.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of ways to organize your inbox. If you use Gmail, my personal favorite is &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/organize-gmail-inbox-zero"&gt;the Klinger method for getting to inbox zero and staying there&lt;/a&gt;. If inbox zero isn't your cup of tea, &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/inbox-organization-tools#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;here's a list of 14 of the best tools for organizing your inbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Organizing your inbox isn't the same as checking email, though. Don't get sucked in! Organize your inbox, and then log off and enjoy your break. Don't forget to let your colleagues and clients know you'll be out -- Here are some &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hilarious-out-of-office-email-auto-replies#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;creative out-of-office messages&lt;/a&gt; we love.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;14) Volunteer.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Serving others has a long list of intangible benefits, like pride, satisfaction, accomplishment, connections with others, strengthening your community, and improving the lives of others. There are health benefits, too: Along with social benefits, &lt;a href="http://www.nationalservice.gov/serve-your-community/benefits-volunteering"&gt;a growing body of research shows&lt;/a&gt; there's a strong relationship between volunteering and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Don't have a specific cause in mind? Check out your local library, youth center, animal shelter, homeless shelter, or hospital to see if they're in need of volunteers. &lt;a href="https://www.volunteermatch.org/"&gt;VolunteerMatch.org&lt;/a&gt; is another great place to find good causes in your local community for a wide variety of time commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;15) Find a quiet space to let your mind wander.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When we're deep in our work routines, it can be hard to tear ourselves away from our immediate tasks and goals. But not removing ourselves from these things can mean we miss out on seeing interesting new connections and developing innovations. This is especially true during the busy weeks leading up to the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Take some time to remove yourself from your day-to-day -- even from your family and friends -- to be alone and reflect. Daydream about being your own customer, or your competitor, or what it's like to &lt;em&gt;be &lt;/em&gt;the product you produce. Analyze how you've been spending your time over the past few months and whether you'd like to make changes in the upcoming year.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;16) Get exercise in.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I'm not going to get into the benefits of exercise (or we'd be here for a while), but the holiday season is an especially hard time to keep a consistent workout routine. Factors like cooler temperatures, less daylight, busy travel schedules, and food-oriented gatherings can all throw off your schedule. But staying active -- even just a little bit each day -- can be easy and fun. &lt;a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/PhysicalActivity/FitnessBasics/American-Heart-Association-Recommendations-for-Physical-Activity-in-Adults_UCM_307976_Article.jsp#"&gt;The American Heart Association recommends&lt;/a&gt; 40 minutes of aerobic exercise three to four times per week.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not an athlete? Physical activity doesn't have to be intense. Find an activity like walking, shoveling snow, vacuuming -- heck, even shopping -- that gets the blood flowing. Something is always better than nothing. And when you head back to the office, keep it up -- here are 10 ways to &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/exercise-at-work#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;sneak in exercise at work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;17) Set goals for next year.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It's amazing how quickly the New Year can sneak up on you. Set aside some time during the holidays to reflect on the past year and make goals for the new one. Setting goals gives you a baseline for measuring success, and the motivation to stay on course when things get crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Setting goals can be as simple as creating two lists: one of your accomplishments this past year, and one of your goals for the next. To get more specific, you can break larger goals into smaller ones by month. If you want to really dig in to your goals and ground them in reality, &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33898/How-to-Set-SMART-Marketing-Goals-for-2013-TEMPLATE.aspx"&gt;try setting SMART goals&lt;/a&gt; (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-bound) and make a plan for staying on course.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;18) Do any work-related tasks in the morning.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Although it'd be ideal to leave all your real work for when you're back in the office, some people simply get &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; stressed out when they're disconnected. The thought of missing an important email, or even just returning to an inbox that's bursting at the seams, can be incredibly daunting for some.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you're one of those people, use the &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/morning-freewriting-productivity#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;morning hours&lt;/a&gt; when everyone else is asleep to get your work-related tasks done. By the time everyone wakes up, you'll have checked off a few key to-dos, and will be able to focus on spending time with family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;19) Watch a documentary.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Holidays are a time for binge-watching all the TV you don't have time for during the work grind, and we won't begrudge you that. But when you're ready for a break, check out a new documentary film. There are documentaries on almost every subject imaginable, and you might learn about a topic or issue that inspires you. &lt;a href="https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/best-documentaries-2016"&gt;Thrillist recommends several here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;20) Prepare meals in advance.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It's typically healthier and more affordable to make your meals than to buy them, but when you're busy with work, it's hard to make time to prepare wholesome meals for yourself and your family. If you're taking a staycation this holiday season, spend some time preparing meals that can be frozen or refrigerated to eat on the go or at the office. Here are some &lt;a href="http://greatist.com/eat/healthy-freezer-meals"&gt;make-ahead breakfast, lunch, and dinner recipes&lt;/a&gt;, including vegan and gluten-free choices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Slack Became The Fastest Growing Business App of All Time [Infographic]</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/slack-fastest-growing-business-app</link>

        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/slack-fastest-growing-business-app" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/cut-yourself-some-slack-compressor%20(1).jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="How Slack Became The Fastest Growing Business App of All Time [Infographic]" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Magic in "Harry Potter" used enchanted paper airplanes. The offices of Sterling Cooper in "Mad Men" used secretaries. Today's modern (and nonfiction) offices rely increasingly on &lt;a href="https://research.hubspot.com/charts/messaging-apps-have-over-4b-monthly-active-users"&gt;messaging apps&lt;/a&gt; for inter-office &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/advertisers-guide-mobile-messaging-apps#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;communcation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One such app is &lt;a href="http://slack.com"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, a real-time messaging app that's currently used by more than 90,000&amp;nbsp;different companies. Slack skyrocketed in popularity, making it the &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/31/7135639/slack-is-now-the-fastest-growing-workplace-software-ever"&gt;fastest-growing&lt;/a&gt; workplace software application ever.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Magic in "Harry Potter" used enchanted paper airplanes. The offices of Sterling Cooper in "Mad Men" used secretaries.

At its core, Slack offers direct messaging and chat rooms for individuals and teams, but takes its&amp;nbsp;software further with a one-stop shop for better &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/slack-tips"&gt;productivity at work&lt;/a&gt;. Slack offers an archive of team- and company-wide communication, as well as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/slack-apps-integrations"&gt;integrations&lt;/a&gt; with other bots and apps you may already be using -- think Google Drive, Trello, and GrowthBot.&lt;a class="cta_button" href="https://offers.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=e8229fac-5f6a-4a3f-a00d-f698a90c991f&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid="&gt; &lt;img class="hs-cta-img " style="border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; " alt="Download our complete productivity guide here for more tips on improving your  productivity at work." src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/e8229fac-5f6a-4a3f-a00d-f698a90c991f.png"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Ultimate List of Websites Every Blogger Should Bookmark</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/bookmarks-for-bloggers</link>
      <description>
        &lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/bookmarks-for-bloggers" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/blogger-websites-to-bookmark.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="The Ultimate List of Websites Every Blogger Should Bookmark" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All bloggers have a number of websites that they visit every single day. Aside from the obvious ones (like email and Twitter), your favorites might be anything from your blog's publishing calendar, to your online to-do list, to all your favorite &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29544/the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-for-creating-social-media-buttons.aspx#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;social media button&lt;/a&gt; generators.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Wouldn't it be great if all of those helpful resources were just a click away?&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;All bloggers have a number of websites that they visit every single day. Aside from the obvious ones (like email and Twitter), your favorites might be anything from your blog's publishing calendar, to your online to-do list, to all your favorite &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29544/the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-for-creating-social-media-buttons.aspx#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;social media button&lt;/a&gt; generators.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Wouldn't it be great if all of those helpful resources were just a click away?&lt;a class="cta_button" href="https://offers.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=c20bdc36-dbaa-4acd-aa13-77a1166afb3c&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid="&gt; &lt;img class="hs-cta-img " style="border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; " alt="Download our free guide here for tips to become a better writer.&amp;nbsp;" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/c20bdc36-dbaa-4acd-aa13-77a1166afb3c.png"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That's exactly what bookmarks are for. In your web browser, bookmarks are links to specific websites that show up as buttons at the top of your web browser -- making it easy to visit your favorite websites.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;How to bookmark websites will depend on the browser you're using. But trust me, it's easy. Here are links to instructions for how to add a bookmark for four popular web browsers:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95739?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21465?locale=en_US"&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/create-bookmarks-save-your-favorite-webpages"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Bookmark-a-Web-Page-on-Internet-Explorer"&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, let's get bookmarking. What are some of the best websites that all &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-blog-post-simple-formula-ht#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;bloggers&lt;/a&gt; should add to their bookmark bar? Check out 30 of the HubSpot blogging team's favorites below. (And be sure to share your own favorites in the comment section.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;30 Websites Every Blogger Should Bookmark&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;For Keeping Organized&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;1) &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-robust-editorial-calendar-ht"&gt;Publishing Calendar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Figuring out when you should publish which blog posts is time-consuming enough, right? Bookmark your publishing calendar so it's only a click away at any given time. You can use it to keep your topics and authors organized, track keyword and call-to-action usage, and make sure all your blog posts are written on time.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If you're a HubSpot customer, you can bookmark &lt;a href="https://help.hubspot.com/articles/KCS_Article/COS-General/How-do-I-schedule-a-piece-of-content-through-the-Calendar"&gt;your HubSpot Calendar App.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If you're not a HubSpot customer, then you can &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-robust-editorial-calendar-ht"&gt;create a publishing calendar using Google Calendar&lt;/a&gt; and bookmark that.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;(Are you also responsible for running your company's social media accounts? Then you might want to bookmark &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-calendar-tools#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;social media publishing calendar&lt;/a&gt; tools as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;2) &lt;a href="https://trello.com/"&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Trello is a really simple collaboration platform you can use to brainstorm and organize your blog post and project ideas. Bookmark it so you can easily add new blog post ideas as you think of them, manage your own post-writing to-do list, and &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/trello-board-tips-for-teams#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;see what the rest of your team&lt;/a&gt; is working on. You can also use it to build an editorial and &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-calendar-tools#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;social media publishing calendar&lt;/a&gt;, prioritize different tasks, and organize notes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Trello%20SS.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Trello%20SS.png" width="669" alt="Trello SS.png" title="Trello SS.png" style="width: 669px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;3) &lt;a href="https://evernote.com/"&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While you can install Evernote &lt;a href="https://appcenter.evernote.com/"&gt;as an app&lt;/a&gt; on your computer and any device, you may also want to make the website a bookmark on your web browser. Even more specifically, you can make notes within your Evernote into separate bookmarks: one for your to-do list, one where you store &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-add-html-embed-codes-ht"&gt;useful snippets of HTML&lt;/a&gt;, one where you &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/productivity-apps-commute#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;store inspiring articles&lt;/a&gt; or ebooks, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/evernote-screenshot-1.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;height=284&amp;amp;name=evernote-screenshot-1.png" width="669" height="284"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;4) &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/14222/The-One-Graph-Marketers-Should-Update-Daily-The-Leads-Waterfall.aspx"&gt;Waterfall Graphs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We use waterfall graphs to keep track of daily progress on our traffic and leads goals on the blog. If you're a HubSpot customer, your marketing software has a &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/14222/The-One-Graph-Marketers-Should-Update-Daily-The-Leads-Waterfall.aspx"&gt;built-in waterfall chart template&lt;/a&gt; that will generate these graphs for you -- so you might want to bookmark that page in HubSpot. If you're not a HubSpot customer, you can &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/14222/The-One-Graph-Marketers-Should-Update-Daily-The-Leads-Waterfall.aspx"&gt;create a waterfall graph yourself&lt;/a&gt; in Google Spreadsheets and bookmark that.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;For Data Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;5) &lt;a href="http://percent-change.com/"&gt;Percent Change Calculator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I can't even begin to tell you how useful this little calculator is when looking for and analyzing data. Ever want to know the percentage change of two values without having to remember the formula? Simply enter the two values into this calculator, and it'll spit out the percentage change.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;6) &lt;a href="http://atlas.qz.com/"&gt;Atlas (by Quartz)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Atlas is Quartz's slickly-designed command center for all its charts. There are all kinds of cool, useful data in there -- everything from Prada's share price over time to the highest CEO-to-worker pay ratios in the U.S. You can download, embed, or grab the data. It's open source so you can create your own versions, too. One of the best ways to build credibility on your blog is to back up your claims with data and evidence, so bookmark resources like Atlas so you can easily search for and grab the data and charts you're looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;7) &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;Comprehensive List of Marketing Statistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whether you're a blogger who writes about about marketing, or you just need statistics to back up your strategy in a team presentation, it's tricky to find the original source of data within the rabbit hole of the internet. We've put together a &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;massive list&lt;/a&gt; of marketing statistics that are up-to-date and categorized for easy reference.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;For Blog Ideation&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;8) &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/"&gt;Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Quora's question-and-answer platform features questions from real people in your audience -- and what better way to appeal to your readers than by answering their questions? Quora also offers an upvoting feature that lets you see how many other users are interested in the answer to a question, which can help you prioritize your response blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/quora_gosling.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=646&amp;amp;name=quora_gosling.png" alt="quora_gosling.png" width="646" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 646px;" title="quora_gosling.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;9) &lt;a href="https://www.portent.com/tools/title-maker"&gt;Portent's Content Idea Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you drop a topic into this neat little tool's search bar, it proposes eye-catching, humorous title and topic ideas for you to test out. It also provides reasoning for the proposed titles, and you can make it spit out a new title idea if you're unsatisfied. It might not produce the perfect title for your &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/validate-blog-post-topics#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, but it will get your creative juices flowing if you're wondering what format or style in which to write.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/portent's.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;height=366&amp;amp;name=portent's.png" alt="portent's.png" width="669" height="366" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;10) &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/blog-topic-generator"&gt;HubSpot's Blog Topic Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Our handy free tool produces a week's worth of &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-simple-formula-for-writing-kick-ass-titles-ht"&gt;blog post title&lt;/a&gt; ideas when you submit three nouns or keywords you're trying to write about. The tool is particularly helpful because you can generate ideas about specific angles by entering several search terms at once. I submitted "blogging," "tools," and "marketing," and I got back these five interesting title proposals:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blogtopicgenerator-1.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;height=309&amp;amp;name=blogtopicgenerator-1.png" alt="blogtopicgenerator-1.png" width="669" height="309" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;For Writing&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;11) &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/the-internet-marketing-written-style-guide"&gt;Style Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you're blogging, posting on social media, and creating other types of marketing content regularly, it's important to have a written style guide to ensure your writing style is consistent across different marketing channels. But it can take a long time to learn all the nuances of your brand's style guide, so have it bookmarked for easy reference while you're &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-editing-checklist#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;writing and editing&lt;/a&gt;. (And if you don't have a style guide yet, &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31247/The-Simple-Template-for-a-Thorough-Content-Style-Guide.aspx"&gt;learn how to create one here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;12) &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht"&gt;Keyword Tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Keyword research comes in handy when you're brainstorming, writing, editing, and creating headlines for your blog posts. That said, keep your favorite keyword tool bookmarked. Here are a few of our favorites:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/free-trial-keywords-tool"&gt;HubSpot's Keyword Tool&lt;/a&gt; (30-day trial)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner"&gt;Google AdWords' Keyword Planner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/trends/"&gt;Google Trends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Want to learn more about how to do keyword research for SEO? &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht"&gt;Check out this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;13) &lt;a href="https://wordcounter.net/"&gt;WordCounter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Although there's no "right answer" for &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-long-should-your-blog-posts-be-faq"&gt;how long a blog post should be&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes word count can come in handy. Bookmark WordCounter so you can quickly paste in your content to see how many words you've written.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;14) &lt;a href="https://dictation.io/"&gt;Dictation.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Let's face it -- if you're a full-time blogger, you might get exhausted by writing sometimes. Don't worry though, it happens to us too. When you need to take a break, try &lt;a href="https://dictation.io/"&gt;Dictation.io&lt;/a&gt;, a dictation tool that translates talk to text. This is a great way to keep the tone of your blog post conversational and to switch things up if you're getting &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/defeat-writers-block"&gt;writer's block&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;For Editing&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;15) &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-editing-checklist"&gt;Pre-Publish Checklist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It can be pretty hard to remember every little thing you should check on a blog post before hitting "Publish." That's why we bookmarked this pre-publish checklist, which is a complete list of everything you should do when editing and proofreading your blog content. It covers everything from ensuring all your &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33098/How-Not-to-Steal-People-s-Content-on-the-Web.aspx"&gt;sources are properly attributed&lt;/a&gt; to double checking all your links work.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;16) &lt;a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/"&gt;Hemingway App&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Have you ever been in the middle of writing a blog post and realized your writing felt a little ... convoluted? Bookmark the free Hemingway App for moments like these. All you have to do is paste your content into it, and it'll assess your writing and identify opportunities to make it simpler. For example, it'll point out instances of passive voice and hard-to-read sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hemingway-app-screenshot-1.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;height=348&amp;amp;name=hemingway-app-screenshot-1.png" width="669" height="348"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;17) &lt;a href="http://tone-analyzer-demo.mybluemix.net/?cm_mmc=developerWorks-_-dWdevcenter-_-watson-_-lp"&gt;Tone Analyzer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the same vein as analyzing readability, what about analyzing tone? Sometimes, you might be reading over a blog post and feel like it comes off as a little too negative or a little too excited. Tone Analyzer is a free tool that uses linguistic analysis to detect the tone of a piece -- and then offers helpful tips on how to improve and strengthen the tone.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;18) &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element"&gt;HTML Elements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you edit a lot of blog posts, chances are you'll be working with HTML on a regular basis. I like to keep this list of HTML elements handy so I can easily make changes to HTML when needed. From there, I can use CTRL + F to jump right to the HTML element I'm looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;19) &lt;a href="http://htmlandcssbook.com/extras/html-escape-codes/"&gt;HTML Score&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Speaking of HTML, here's another great HTML resource to bookmark. It's a long list of special characters that HTML 4.0 processors should support, like the copyright symbol Â©, currency symbols â‚¬ Â¥ Â¢, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/html-special-characters-tutorial.gif?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=200&amp;amp;height=150&amp;amp;name=html-special-characters-tutorial.gif" width="200" height="150"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image Credit: &lt;a href="http://htmlandcssbook.com/extras/html-escape-codes/"&gt;HTML Score&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;20) &lt;a href="http://www.html-cleaner.com/"&gt;HTML Cleaner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Source codes can sometimes seem to take on a personality of their own and pull in crazy HTML snippets -- especially if you're copying and pasting from an external file, like Google Docs. If you find yourself having that problem regularly, bookmark a tool like HTML Cleaner so you can quickly remove any superfluous code from your content.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;21) &amp;amp; 22) &lt;a href="https://www.grammarly.com/"&gt;Grammarly&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://www.correctica.com/"&gt;Correctica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before you can officially say you're done editing a blog post, you should run it through an editing tool like Grammarly or Correctica to triple-check there are no grammatical errors. (Bonus: Grammarly even checks for plagiarism.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;23) &lt;a href="http://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer"&gt;Headline Analyzer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You've written and edited your blog post. At this point, the only thing standing between your cursor and the "Publish" button is an eye-catching headline. Once you have a few ideas in mind, head to your bookmark bar and open up the Headline Analyzer, a free tool that scores your headline quality and rates its ability to drive social shares, traffic, and SEO value. It also shows you how it will appear in search results.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;24) &lt;a href="https://stocksnap.io/"&gt;StockSnap.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once you've written your blog post, a great header image captures reader attention on social media. There are numerous &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-stock-photos#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;stock photo websites&lt;/a&gt; featuring free photo downloads that you're free to distribute, and we like StockSnap.io's &lt;a href="https://stocksnap.io/view-photos/sort/trending/desc"&gt;trending feature&lt;/a&gt; that shows you popular photo downloads -- so you can steer clear of them to make your blog posts more unique than other web content.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;25) &lt;a href="https://compressor.io/"&gt;Compressor.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A photo compressor can help speed up the time it takes to load your web page and make your photos smaller for easy social media sharing. Drop your stock photo of choice into &lt;a href="https://compressor.io/"&gt;Compressor.io&lt;/a&gt;, and it will generate a new, compressed image for you to download and use in your blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;For Social Media&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;26) &lt;a href="https://clicktotweet.com/basic"&gt;ClickToTweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Creating a tweetable link is a lot easier than learning custom code. Bookmark ClickToTweet so you can create basic tweetable links to accompany cool quotes in your blog posts at a moment's notice. (&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-generate-click-to-tweet-links-cta-quick-tip-ht"&gt;Learn how it works here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;27) &lt;a href="https://business.pinterest.com/en/widget-builder#do_pin_it_button"&gt;Pinterest's "Pin It" Button Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ever seen those "Pin it" buttons that let you pin an image to your Pinterest board? We use Pinterest's "Pin it" button widget builder all the time to create those buttons for images we post on our blog.

      <title>6 Little Ways to Delight Your Customers This Holiday Season</title>

        &lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/customer-delight-ideas-holiday" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Reward%20Your%20Customers.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="6 Little Ways to Delight Your Customers This Holiday Season" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It is much more cost effective to keep a customer than it is to find a new one. In fact, according to &lt;a href="http://success.adobe.com/assets/en/downloads/whitepaper/13926.digital_index_loyal_shoppers_report.pdf"&gt;a report by Adobe&lt;/a&gt;, returning customers account for up to &lt;a href="https://www.sweettoothrewards.com/blog/repeat-customers-profitable-stats-to-prove/"&gt;40% of a companyâ€™s revenue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Trouble is, a &lt;a href="https://www.bellycard.com/resources/customer-retention-marketing-insights/"&gt;2016 small business survey&lt;/a&gt; revealed that while 72% of small businesses plan to allocate the majority of their marketing budget to customer acquisition, only 28% plan to allocate the majority to customer retention.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, according to &lt;a href="http://success.adobe.com/assets/en/downloads/whitepaper/13926.digital_index_loyal_shoppers_report.pdf"&gt;a report by Adobe&lt;/a&gt;, returning customers account for up to &lt;a href="https://www.sweettoothrewards.com/blog/repeat-customers-profitable-stats-to-prove/"&gt;40% of a companyâ€™s revenue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Trouble is, a &lt;a href="https://www.bellycard.com/resources/customer-retention-marketing-insights/"&gt;2016 small business survey&lt;/a&gt; revealed that while 72% of small businesses plan to allocate the majority of their marketing budget to customer acquisition, only 28% plan to allocate the majority to customer retention.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To help marketers refocus their retention plans -- especially those in the ecommerce industry -- I've put together six creative ways to keep your loyal customers coming back. Check them out below.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;6 Little Ways to Reward Your Customers This Holiday Season&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1) Offer a compelling discount.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By a compelling discount, I donâ€™t simply mean â€œ20% off your next order.â€ Instead, try a discount that will inspire your customer to continue shopping with you.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What does that look like? It depends. And there are a couple things to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the value your product or service provides customers,&lt;/strong&gt; not just the price you discount it by. In other words, position yourself in a way where buying your product is a complete no-brainer.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose your words carefully. &lt;/strong&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/consumed/201209/differentiating-discounts"&gt;re&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/consumed/201209/differentiating-discounts"&gt;search from Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;, a â€œGet $ Offâ€ promotion emphasizes achieving a gain, while the "Save $" wording emphasizes avoiding a loss -- and customers recognize that difference.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For example, check out how &lt;a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; positioned this holiday deal on the Samsung Gear S2:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/t-mobile-holiday-discount.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=t-mobile-holiday-discount.png" alt="t-mobile-holiday-discount.png" width="669" title="t-mobile-holiday-discount.png" style="width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;2) Get personal.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Great customer service is about more than just solving your customerâ€™s issue. Try going above and beyond by creating something awesome to remind your customers why they love your business.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For example, you might send out a personalized holiday card or thank you note to their home address. Even though weâ€™re in a digital word, it means a lot to receive something handwritten, and capitalizing on the holiday spirit in this way can build a positive brand association.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not only do the folks at &lt;a href="https://buffer.com/"&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt; engage their audience on social, but they also go out of their way to send handwritten cards, stickers, and t-shirts to their clients:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Wearing my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/buffer"&gt;@buffer&lt;/a&gt; t-shirt with pride. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bufferlove?src=hash"&gt;#bufferlove&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/bWpjalt2nW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bWpjalt2nW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; â€” Jason Thompson (@nosaj_jason)
        &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nosaj_jason/status/691415968757747713"&gt;January 25, 2016&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Their strategy works well because with every exchange, they are encouraging customers to become brand ambassadors.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;3) Tap into referrals that reward.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Referrals are a great way to get customers to sell your products for you. Itâ€™s a simple evolution of word-of-mouth marketing, as customers usually refer friends or colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For example, when shopping with &lt;a href="http://www.theclymb.com/"&gt;The Clymb&lt;/a&gt;, you are gently reminded to refer a friend in the website header:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Invite%20a%20Friend.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Invite%20a%20Friend.png" alt="Invite a Friend.png" width="669" title="Invite a Friend.png" style="width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Notice how it provides a clear call-to-action along with an incentive -- $10 for your loyal customer and $10 for a future one -- encouraging visitors to take action even before they start shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;4) Use premium packaging.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Anyone that's spent any amount of time wresting with a roll of wrapping paper and tape dispenser knows the value of a pretty package. In fact, &lt;a href="http://www.dotcomdist.com/Unwrapping-the-Customer-Experience"&gt;according to a 2015 Dotcom Distribution packaging study&lt;/a&gt;, 49% of online shoppers said that branded packaging made them more excited about receiving or opening an item, while 44% admitted that packaging reinforces that a product is worth its cost.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The lesson? First impressions make a huge difference in our fast-paced lives, so by using premium packaging you allow your product to stand out against others. Take &lt;a href="http://www.padandquill.com/"&gt;Pad &amp;amp; Quill&lt;/a&gt;, for example. This tech accessories company packages its iPhone and iPad cases in paper with friendly messages printed on it. It even uses an authentic-looking Roman seal to give a more hand-wrapped feel.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/customer-loyalty-holidays-pad-and-quill.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=customer-loyalty-holidays-pad-and-quill.jpg" alt="customer-loyalty-holidays-pad-and-quill.jpg" width="669" title="customer-loyalty-holidays-pad-and-quill.jpg" style="width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;5) Turn the small print into a feature.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Refund and exchange policies are often part of the small print on your website. During the holiday season, you have an opportunity to make them a feature. After all, these policies are in place to increase trust and promote sales, right? Make them known.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When buying gifts, customers prefer a return policy that ensures that if the recipient doesnâ€™t like it, they can easily return it. If you can offer this, you have a better shot at increasing sales, while keeping your customers happy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/"&gt;Nordstrom&lt;/a&gt; does a great job of displaying all of its holiday shopping, shipping, and return perks right on the homepage, giving potential and existing customers peace of mind during one of the more stressful times of the year:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Nordstrom%20Return%20Policy.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=Nordstrom%20Return%20Policy.png" alt="Nordstrom Return Policy.png" width="669" title="Nordstrom Return Policy.png" style="width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;6) Create a holiday-inspired video.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Why does everyone love and anticipate the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuz2ILq4UeA"&gt;John Lewis&lt;/a&gt; holiday advertisements year after year? Because they tell a story that evokes emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, you donâ€™t need a million-dollar TV advertising budget to do this, just an idea for a great story. &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-marketing-statistics#sm.00001jv8k2j9vzembr7434ir2v3u3"&gt;As video is becoming more and more popular&lt;/a&gt;, itâ€™s key that you apply it to all areas of your marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Back in 2014, the Lowell Police Department went viral due to its "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlnxajQrL8w"&gt;Christmas Surprise Traffic Stop&lt;/a&gt;" video. In the video, police officers asked the folks they pulled over for traffic violations questions about what they wanted for the holidays. Meanwhile, their behind-the-scenes crew quickly purchased the items and drove them to the scene. Watch the magic unfold below -- trust us, it's worth the four minutes:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
        &lt;iframe style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mlnxajQrL8w" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The holiday season is a time of giving, so be creative with how you can implement goodwill into your marketing campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Offering compelling discounts with creative call-to-actions will inspire your customers to buy, but great customer service is why they return.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Remember to focus on the value that you are bringing your customer, not just how low you can get your prices.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Sundberg's team &lt;a href="http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/infographic-what-cost-hiring-wrong-employee/"&gt;based their calculations&lt;/a&gt; on the cost of a second-level manager who makes $62,000 a year and is terminated after two and a half years. They considered the cost of hiring, onboarding, and retaining the employee, as well as the overall revenue loss associated with mistakes, failures, and missed business opportunities caused during the employee's doomed tenure.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you work at a small agency, &lt;strong&gt;losing that amount of money over a single bad hire can cause unthinkable damage to your bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;. There's simply no room for hiring mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To ensure your next hiring decision isn't a major pitfall for your business, we've compiled a list of common reasons behind poor hiring choices. Avoid these at all costs to make sure your next new hire succeeds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;4 Common Mistakes That Lead to Bad Hires&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;1) You fall victim to "The halo effect."&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Imagine you're a hiring manager conducting interviews for an account manager position. After a long day of mediocre and disappointing candidates, your next interviewee turns out to be eloquent, positive, and friendly -- a welcome combination of traits that impress you immediately. On top of his enjoyable presence, he has a pretty solid resume. You hire him right away.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A few months after he's been onboarded, you hear word from his manager that his performance has been disappointing so far, and he shows no signs of improvement. So what went wrong? &lt;strong&gt;How could the candidate who impressed you so much in the interview turn out to be a total dud?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a perfect example of the &lt;em&gt;halo effect&lt;/em&gt;: a type of cognitive bias that occurs when we overlook obvious faults when someone impresses us in one particular area. In this case, you were impressed by the candidate's sociable demeanor, and assumed he'd be equally impressive in other areas. His &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/resume-tips-things-recruiters-hate"&gt;resume might not have been stellar&lt;/a&gt;, but since you were already sold on his sociability, &lt;strong&gt;you didn't even notice you were overlooking potential issues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Beating the halo effect starts with being aware of its impact, and &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/avoid-hiring-mistakes-recruiting-guide"&gt;developing a straightforward hiring system&lt;/a&gt; to offset its effect. Melvin Sorcher and James Brant -- partners with Sorcher Associates, a management consulting firm -- &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2002/02/are-you-picking-the-right-leaders"&gt;recommend putting an evaluation&lt;/a&gt; process in place which requires candidates to be assessed by a group of people from different levels and areas of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"The process enables the group to probe a wide range of leadership criteria and obtain balanced and complete information," Sorcher and Brant &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2002/02/are-you-picking-the-right-leaders"&gt;wrote in Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt;. When a candidate is reviewed by a wide range of people, &lt;strong&gt;it exposes them to varying sets of opinions and biases&lt;/strong&gt;, minimizing the potential impact the halo effect can have on the hiring decision.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;2) You don't know what the position &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; requires.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Most job requirements come in list format: a neat index of basic skills, recommended experience, and personal traits that somehow combine to describe the ideal person for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, succeeding in most roles requires more than a laundry list of vague qualities -- particularly in the fast-paced, ever-evolving agency landscape. Hiring managers seeking candidates for a new position should set aside time before the interviews to dig a little deeper and &lt;strong&gt;discover "the pivot" -- the elusive set of qualities that tips the scale towards one candidate over another.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"The pivot" is a term coined by Ram Charan, a business advisor and author of &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://hbr.org/product/boards-that-lead-when-to-take-charge-when-to-partner-and-when-to-stay-out-of-the-way/an/10817E-KND-ENG"&gt;Boards That Lead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. As Charan &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2016/12/the-secrets-of-great-ceo-selection"&gt;describes it&lt;/a&gt;, the pivot is "a strand of two or three capabilities that are tightly interwoven and required for the new leader to succeed." In other words, the pivot is what &lt;strong&gt;separates someone who will be an average performer in the role from someone who will truly flourish and exceed your biggest expectations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For example, when hiring a new business development manager, the pivot might be a background in economics, an adaptive nature, and a unique ability to remain calm and collected in stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"Directors who choose the right CEOs do a lot of work before arriving at the pivot," Charan &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2016/12/the-secrets-of-great-ceo-selection"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;. "They take the time to fully understand the company's current challenges and how the external context is changing. They read analyst reports, talk to insiders, and consult outside experts to expand their thinking."&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Although Charan uses "the pivot" as a way to help companies hire CEOs and other major leadership positions, it's useful for all hiring managers to &lt;strong&gt;think about what specific abilities really put a candidate over the edge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;3) You focus too heavily on technical skills and not enough on intangibles.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Technical skills are important -- don't get me wrong -- but they hardly ever make up for larger issues with an employee's disposition, attitude, and work ethic. Hiring an employee primarily on the merit of their technical skills could cause you to overlook other major red flags -- and might lead to a wasted investment in an unfit employee.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.leadershipiq.com/blogs/leadershipiq/35354241-why-new-hires-fail-emotional-intelligence-vs-skills#"&gt;a study conducted by Leadership IQ&lt;/a&gt; -- a leadership training and development company -- new employees rarely fail due to issues with their job competence or technical skills. In fact, of the new hires that were terminated within 18 months of being hired, &lt;strong&gt;only 11% failed due to technical shortcomings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So what were the top reasons new hires didn't succeed in their new roles? Issues taking feedback, inadequate &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/emotional-intelligence"&gt;emotional intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, and a lack of motivation caused more employees to fail than gaps in technical job competency.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Check out the full breakdown of the survey below:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/hiringfailures-chart%202.png?t=1483790613555"&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: #808080;"&gt;Image Credit:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.leadershipiq.com/blogs/leadershipiq/35354241-why-new-hires-fail-emotional-intelligence-vs-skills#"&gt;Leadership IQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;The typical job interview process fixates on ensuring that new hires are technically competent&lt;/strong&gt;," explained Mark Murphy, CEO of Leadership IQ, on their &lt;a href="http://www.leadershipiq.com/blogs/leadershipiq/35354241-why-new-hires-fail-emotional-intelligence-vs-skills#"&gt;company blog&lt;/a&gt;. "But coachability, emotional intelligence, motivation and temperament are much more predictive of a new hire's success or failure. Do technical skills really matter if the employee isn't open to improving, alienates their coworkers, lacks emotional intelligence and has the wrong personality for the job?"&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It's easy to get blinded by an employee's impressive technical skill set, but hiring managers need to look beyond the resume and make sure candidates have the right attitude, disposition, and mindset for the role&amp;nbsp;as well.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;4) You treat every open position like an emergency hire.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sometimes it's necessary to get someone hired and onboarded as quickly as possible for the overall stability of the agency -- but most of the time, you can afford to take enough time with the hiring process to find someone who will bring the right energy to the role.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In periods of rapid growth, agencies often feel the need to acquire talent expeditiously, without much thought to the hiring framework or time line. With this attitude, it's easy for unfit hires to slip through the cracks when they wouldn't have otherwise been considered.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Linda Brenner, a coauthor of &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Valuation-Accelerate-Capitalization-Important/dp/0134009681"&gt;Talent Valuation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and the CEO of Talent Growth Advisors, emphasizes the importance of prioritizing hiring for open roles according to &lt;em&gt;long-term&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;business needs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Start by identifying which roles are most essential to delivering on future growth commitments&lt;/strong&gt; -- not just to continuing your operations right now," Brenner &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3059758/3-hiring-mistakes-most-companies-dont-realize-theyre-making"&gt;writes in Fast Company&lt;/a&gt;. "Finding and hiring top talent in those areas is most essential."&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once you've identified which roles to prioritize, develop a hiring time line&amp;nbsp;that allows your team adequate time to select ideal candidates. If you start hiring now for roles that will be essential in the coming months or years, you'll be able to conduct a more thorough process that yields better candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inbound Marketingâ€™s Second Act: 4 Things Every Inbound Marketer Should Do in 2017</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/inbound-marketing-second-act</link>
      <description>
        &lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/inbound-marketing-second-act" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/inbound-marketing-second-act.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="Inbound Marketingâ€™s Second Act: 4 Things Every Inbound Marketer Should Do in 2017" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;2016 marks HubSpotâ€™s 10th anniversary. When my co-founder Dharmesh Shah and I first started talking about the concept of inbound marketing, it wasnâ€™t an evolution -- it was a revolution. Instead of big brands beating small companies with expensive TV commercials, massive billboards, and other types of outbound campaigns as a foregone conclusion, content and search marketing equalized the playing field. Marketing became much more about the &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/50/Four-Ways-the-Internet-Is-Transforming-Small-Business.aspx#sm.000017utsixyohcqorv73zt615ndz"&gt;width of your brain than the width of your wallet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;2016 marks HubSpotâ€™s 10th anniversary. When my co-founder Dharmesh Shah and I first started talking about the concept of inbound marketing, it wasnâ€™t an evolution -- it was a revolution. Instead of big brands beating small companies with expensive TV commercials, massive billboards, and other types of outbound campaigns as a foregone conclusion, content and search marketing equalized the playing field. Marketing became much more about the &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/50/Four-Ways-the-Internet-Is-Transforming-Small-Business.aspx#sm.000017utsixyohcqorv73zt615ndz"&gt;width of your brain than the width of your wallet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today. While the fundamental tenets of inbound marketing still ring true, many of the specific channels and methods prospects are using to find, evaluate, and purchase products are different than 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Even the supply and demand dynamics have changed. In 2006, prospects had an average of four to five choices for any product or service they were looking to purchase. In 2016, I've found that that number has spiked to approximately 14 or 15 different vendors -- and this holds among most industries. Choices that once occupied a few inches on a shelf at a retail store now expand endlessly on the infinite shelf of ecommerce sites.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Supply is way up, and demand is relatively flat. The increased competition means understanding how your prospective buyers research and buy is even more critical.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve spent the last year studying the changes in prospect behavior, and Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that weâ€™re looking at another revolution -- which heralds the second act of inbound marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hereâ€™s what that means for you, your prospects, your business, and your 2017 marketing plan.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;The Second Act of Inbound Marketing&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;How to Get Found in 2016 (or, Why Google Is Now Ask Jeeves)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Back in 2006, Google helped buyers find the answers to their questions by serving up links to relevant information. Increasingly today, thereâ€™s no click needed -- Google just gives searchers the answer directly through a rich answer box. The numbers vary on this but research has found that between &lt;a href="https://www.stonetemple.com/the-growth-of-rich-answers-in-googles-search-results/"&gt;20 and 35%&lt;/a&gt; of searches performed today result in a quick answer box populated on the SERP itself.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/featured-snippet-1.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=featured-snippet-1.png" alt="featured-snippet-1.png" width="669" title="featured-snippet-1.png?noresize" style="width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Need an answer fast? Just ask. Thatâ€™s right, Google has finally fulfilled the original Ask Jeeves promise. In our own research weâ€™ve found that &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-featured-snippet-box"&gt;clickthrough rates from these answer boxes are also higher than traditional links&lt;/a&gt;. RKG Merkle saw a &lt;a href="http://searchengineland.com/seo-featured-snippets-leads-big-gains-236212"&gt;516% increase in sessions&lt;/a&gt; when a clientâ€™s page captured the snippet box.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To adapt, companies should start to create content not just intended to rank in search, but also to be pulled into Googleâ€™s quick answer box, and educate your buyer directly on the SERP. &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-featured-snippet-box"&gt;Hereâ€™s a blog post on how to do this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Quick answer boxes are not the only way Google is changing. Ten years ago, paid AdWords results took up about 50% of the screen â€œabove the fold.â€ Today, &lt;a href="http://searchengineland.com/243057-243057"&gt;because of a layout shift Google introduced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, AdWords ads have moved from the right column to the center and take up nearly &lt;i&gt;100%&lt;/i&gt; of the â€œabove the foldâ€ space on both desktop and mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All of which means: If you have the budget, itâ€™s worth integrating ads into your inbound strategy. But how do you run ads in an â€œinboundâ€ way? Well, bad ads are still useless. If you have a piece of content, however, thatâ€™s taken off organically, thatâ€™s a good indication it could be even more useful if amplified by some paid budget. Iâ€™d suggest using your ad budget to boost quality content that has already done well on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Speaking of social media, Facebookâ€™s &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-lead-generation-tips-ht#sm.000017utsixyohcqorv73zt615ndz"&gt;Lead Ads&lt;/a&gt; product, which enables buyers to complete a form directly in their newsfeeds, is opening up new opportunities and levels of transparency into an ad campaignâ€™s effectiveness. Whereas once we had PPC, weâ€™re now seeing the early days of PPL: Pay Per Lead.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pay-per-lead.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=pay-per-lead.png" alt="pay-per-lead.png" width="669" title="pay-per-lead.png" style="width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The ad industry is at a significant precipice. On the one hand weâ€™re seeing a drastic rise in usage of ad-blocking technology; according to the &lt;a href="http://www.stateofinbound.com/"&gt;2016 State of Inbound report&lt;/a&gt;, mobile ad blocking has increased 90% year-over-year. On the other, ads are getting more space in search engine results and offering better clarity around their cost per lead ratios. All of this will inevitably influence the way prospective customers find your company.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;How to Create Compelling Content in 2016 (or, Why the Silent Movie Is Back)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The way people find answers and discover companies is changing, but so is the format of content itself. Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve noticed about the types of content working well today.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In short: Reading is out, watching is in. Ten years ago, the power content marketing move was search + written content. Now, itâ€™s social media + video content.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-and-video-content.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=social-and-video-content.png" alt="social-and-video-content.png" width="669" title="social-and-video-content.png" style="width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And these arenâ€™t the hyper-produced, long-form videos from years past. The marketing teams&amp;nbsp;winning the video game today are mastering live, off-the-cuff video. Additionally, Charlie Chaplin would likely raise an eyebrow to learn weâ€™ve tÆ’urned away from talkies: &lt;a href="http://digiday.com/platforms/silent-world-facebook-video/"&gt;A full 85% of videos today are watched without audio.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-live-4.png?noresize&amp;amp;t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;name=facebook-live-4.png" alt="facebook-live-4.png" width="300" title="facebook-live-4.png" style="width: 300px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Increases in mobile usage have fueled much of this growth in video popularity. For content marketers, the takeaway here is simple. While text is still important, you may want to stop looking for that next blogger, and start looking for a video producer. At least 50% or more of your marketing content next year should be in video format, either hosted natively on social or created with social distribution in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The other thing to know about content consumption is much of it is now happening away from the bounds of your website on social media. Social media has evolved from a promotion channel alone to a platform for content. Buyers arenâ€™t just stopping by social media sites during work breaks anymore -- they never leave.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Facebook in particular has started to dominate how we spend our free time. Four of the apps consumers &lt;a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/business/intelligence/most-popular-apps-2016/"&gt;use most&lt;/a&gt; -- Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp -- are owned by Facebook. Todayâ€™s buyers are plugged into Mark Zuckerbergâ€™s universe all day long. If youâ€™re not meeting them there, you risk losing them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;How Buyers Buy in 2016 (or, Why Uber Wrecked Your Website)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, your website augmented your sales rep. Buyers would browse the website to get the basics, and then hop on the phone with a salesperson to get into the nitty gritty.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Today, itâ€™s the opposite: Your sales rep augments your website. Buyers want a self-service experience, making a purchase directly onsite or contacting Sales when &lt;i&gt;theyâ€™re&lt;/i&gt; ready, not the other way around. Indeed, only 19% of buyers in a &lt;a href="https://research.hubspot.com/reports/buyers-speak-out-how-sales-needs-to-evolve#LINK3"&gt;HubSpot Research study&lt;/a&gt; said they wanted to talk to a salesperson during the â€œawarenessâ€ stage of their purchase process.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And the website of 2006 wonâ€™t cut it. Your prospects have been trained in every industry to expect automation, personalization, and self-service. They have been spoiled by Uber to expect a consumer-grade, on-demand buying experience. A website that doesnâ€™t enable viewers to get on-demand information or instantly chat with Sales or Support frustrates your buyers and will send them into the arms of your competition.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/website-2016.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=website-2016.png" alt="website-2016.png" width="669" title="website-2016.png" style="width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Throughout the entire buying process -- from your ads, to your website (mobile and desktop), to your &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/evolution-of-business-conversations"&gt;live chat service&lt;/a&gt; -- buyers expect personalization. They expect you to remember them, give them fantastic service, and enable them to serve themselves through automation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;My Advice For Marketers in 2017 and Beyond&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here are the four things I think every marketer should do next year:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest in video&lt;/strong&gt;. Diversify your content playbook to include social + video in addition to text + search.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live in social&lt;/strong&gt;. Weâ€™re not B2B or B2C marketers -- weâ€™re business to human marketers. Humans live in Snapchat, Instagram, Messenger, and a host of other social apps. Find them there.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerate your content&lt;/strong&gt;. Combine content marketing and paid marketing. Repurpose your most successful content for multiple channels and boost it with budget.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automate your buying process&lt;/strong&gt;. Buyers expect to be able to buy on their timeline with either minimal or no human contact.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/marketing-advice-2017.png?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=669&amp;amp;name=marketing-advice-2017.png" alt="marketing-advice-2017.png" width="669" title="marketing-advice-2017.png" style="width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2017 marks the second act of inbound marketing. Are you ready?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seasonal-marketing-campaign-guide" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Seasonal-Campaign-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555" alt="Seasonal-Campaign-compressor.jpg" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Seasonal events and celebrations present different opportunities for different business sectors. For many brands, seasonal opportunities are huge and often the most commercially critical times of the financial year.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But planning an effective seasonal campaign not only takes a lot of organisation, it also takes a considerable amount of time. For this reason, smaller brands tend to let these opportunities come and go without making the most of them.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Seasonal-Campaign-compressor.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=730&amp;amp;height=302&amp;amp;name=Seasonal-Campaign-compressor.jpg" alt="Seasonal-Campaign-compressor.jpg" width="730" height="302"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Seasonal events and celebrations present different opportunities for different business sectors. For many brands, seasonal opportunities are huge and often the most commercially critical times of the financial year.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But planning an effective seasonal campaign not only takes a lot of organisation, it also takes a considerable amount of time. For this reason, smaller brands tend to let these opportunities come and go without making the most of them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rather than miss out on an opportunity to connect with you audience and leverage the ongoing conversation during any given season, we put together some tips designed to help you get your campaign off the ground. Let's walk through them below.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to Plan a Seasonal Marketing Campaign: A 5-Step Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Step #1: Choose a seasonal opportunity.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When choosing a season to serve as the jumping off point for your campaign, it's important that you're being strategic. In simple terms, one of the key routes to &lt;a href="https://www.zazzlemedia.co.uk/seasonal-campaign-planning/"&gt;success with seasonal campaigns&lt;/a&gt; is using an opportunity that engages your audience. If your audience doesn't engage with the season itself, you canâ€™t expect to see results from a campaign centred around it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That said, if you have conducted research into your audience, then youâ€™ll likely know their attitudes around these big seasonal events and should be able to pair that with an event that suits your product or service.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Audit Existing Seasonal Campaigns&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once you have decided on a seasonal event to utilise for a campaign, have a look at some of the last few yearsâ€™ most successful content campaigns for this occasion -- &lt;a href="https://ahrefs.com/"&gt;Ahrefs &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://buzzsumo.com/"&gt;BuzzSumo&lt;/a&gt; are great places to start with this. When evaluating existing, successful campaigns, spend some time thinking about how each piece approached content format, distribution, messaging, and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When validating a campaign, you might find that it's helpful to ask yourself the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;How has this piece used multiple content types and distribution platforms?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Is the messaging clear and if so, what is it?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What emotion does this campaign evoke in the user?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This type of analysis makes it easier for you to uncover common denominators that may inspire the ideation for your own campaign and contribute to your strategy when planning.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Gather Insights via External Outreach&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you're looking for an outsider's opinion, try doing some outreach to journalists or various digital publications that have previously covered some of the campaigns you analyzed above.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By sending out some feelers to see what kind of content they like to post around your chosen season, and when they like to receive press releases for these pieces, is a valuable way to spend a couple of hours or so.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That isnâ€™t to say you must take the feedback you get as gospel, but it is good to bear in mind when you are planning your seasonal campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Step #2: Nail down the messaging.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As with any marketing campaign, your seasonal campaign messaging is so important. To help you get started, you should be thinking the following:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The customer journey and the story you want to tell&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The emotions you want to evoke in your audience&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A call-to-action or the desired next steps you want to encourage&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In 2013, MegaRed -- a company that sells a type of krill oil supplement that is good for your heart -- launched a noteworthy digital Valentine's Day campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The basis of the campaign was simple: â€˜Whose Heart do you Love?â€™ consisted of a video piece that urged viewers to give the gift of a healthy heart to someone they love on Valentine's Day by applying for a free sample of MegaRed via its Facebook Page. To return the love, MegaRed would send the user a free sample, too.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
        &lt;iframe style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_gJ839Os_fM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To add an additional tug on the old heart strings, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/business/media/megared-promotes-my-healthy-valentine.html"&gt;MegaRed also promised&lt;/a&gt; that once 100,000 free samples has been claimed, it would donate $100,000 to the National Coalition for Women With Heart Disease.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When it comes to messaging, this campaign hit on all the points mentioned above:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The customer journey and the story you want to tell:&lt;/strong&gt; The messaging focused on new customer acquisition, and pushed the universal importance of hearth health.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The emotions you want to evoke in your audience: &lt;/strong&gt;In this case, it was love. MegaRed promoted its product by urging those watching to help their loved ones take care of themselves and their heart.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A call-to-action or the desired next steps you want to encourage: &lt;/strong&gt;Request a free sample.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Step #3: Establish a schedule.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With seasonal campaigns, timing is of the essence. This means not only scheduling time to plan well in advance of the event, but also planning the execution of each stage of the campaign at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With todayâ€™s journalists, editors, and site owners receiving hundreds of content pitches and press releases each and every day, you can imagine the influx they receive around peak seasonal times. That said, you need to have your content prepared, built, planned and ready to be sent to sites at least two months before the big event -- preferably sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When creating a schedule for your campaign, don't forget about your audience. When is the best time to contact them? When will they be most willing to share the content or engage with the campaign? Plan around that, too.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Step #4: Organise your assets.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You should consider all marketing platforms -- email, social, PR, blogging, SEO -- when planning your seasonal content campaign, as incorporating different platforms in your campaign allows for an effective content flow, increased reach, and increased engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One of Zazzleâ€™s most successful seasonal campaigns was one done for AO.com, a retailer specialising in household appliances. This simple idea -- â€˜A Guide to the Ultimate Christmas Dinnerâ€™ -- manifested into a truly successful campaign that spanned many different content formats and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Zazzle%20Christmas%20Campaign.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=437&amp;amp;height=195&amp;amp;name=Zazzle%20Christmas%20Campaign.jpg" alt="Zazzle Christmas Campaign.jpg" width="437" height="195" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;â†“&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Zazzle%20Christmas%20Campaign%20Food%20Guide.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=451&amp;amp;height=208&amp;amp;name=Zazzle%20Christmas%20Campaign%20Food%20Guide.jpg" alt="Zazzle Christmas Campaign Food Guide.jpg" width="451" height="208" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;â†“&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Zazzle%20Christmas%20Campaign%20Recipe.jpg?t=1483790613555&amp;amp;width=445&amp;amp;height=363&amp;amp;name=Zazzle%20Christmas%20Campaign%20Recipe.jpg" alt="Zazzle Christmas Campaign Recipe.jpg" width="445" height="363" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The hero piece was a content hub that sat on the AO.com blog. This interactive piece greeted the user with 12 of the staple ingredients that make up a Christmas dinner that, when clicked on, lead to a simple recipe on how to cook them -- including both an ingredients list and a methodology. This recipe could then be downloaded by clicking a â€˜download recipeâ€™ CTA.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Outside of the content hub, we created an infographic that detailed step-by-step instructions for cooking a Christmas dinner. This was distributed via our blogger relations team to help AO.com's campaign gain traction on related websites.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then it came down to outreach. And with the help of an organized press release and PR push, this campaign was featured in three different articles -- including spots on Daily Mail, The Huffington Post, and 50 Connect.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finally, due to the useful nature of the content, it shared well on social platforms, adding to the overall success and visibility of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The lesson? Think big picture when planning your campaign assets. By distributing your campaign's message across different mediums and placements, it's easier for folks to find it and share it with their following.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip: &lt;/strong&gt;Having an effective, up-to-date campaign plan document is absolutely essential during this part of the process. It will enable you to better organize the timing and frequency of content release, and keep your messaging consistent by serving as a home for all of your campaign assets and communications. Check out &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/content-planning-template"&gt;these content marketing planning templates&lt;/a&gt; to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Step #5: Report and remain agile.&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Something that is imperative when managing and planning a marketing campaign is the ability to be agile. Report and review the campaignâ€™s performance as you go along and adjust your strategy if you feel it's necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Where is the majority of traffic coming from? Which pages have the best bounce rate? Which ones are converting the best? Use these simple metrics, and other campaign success measurements, to inform your strategy moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Donâ€™t be afraid to make alterations to the original plans. If the changes you are going to make will ultimately improve the campaignâ€™s success, why wouldnâ€™t you make them? Remember: It doesnâ€™t matter that this plan isnâ€™t what you started with.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With 2017 coming at us full steam ahead, begin to think about which seasonal events your brand could benefit from over the next 12 months. After all, nailing these seasonal campaigns could be the key to your best financial year yet.&lt;/p&gt;
