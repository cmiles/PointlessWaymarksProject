# Pointless Waymarks - Feed Reader

The Pointless Waymarks Feed Reader is part of the [Pointless Waymarks Project](https://github.com/cmiles/PointlessWaymarksProject).

*At this point there are no public installers/releases from the Pointless Waymarks Project - the code is MIT Licensed made public on GitHub to share with friends, colleagues and anyone who finds the code interesting or useful. This project is probably only suitable for use if you enjoy debugging and working on code!*

These days I'm loving 'local' desktop software - no reliance on someone else's server, no need to maintain my own server, no questions about where my data is! And with some activities/software I'm starting to see local network only, desktop only, as an interesting feature - reading Feeds, catching up and following links is a great start of the day - a modern version of the coffee and newspaper ritual - but in the AM is probably enough, too many things to do out in the real world, too many things to build and create to get stuck doom scrolling the web.

This program is designed to be a fairly simple bare-bones feed reader - I've tried to organize feeds and take advantage of additional features in feed readers dating back to Nick Bradbury's FeedDemon and at this point I'm convinced that a good approach is a simple list of feeds with minimal options for controlling 'read' state, a simple list of feeds and a list of saved items. That's it!
