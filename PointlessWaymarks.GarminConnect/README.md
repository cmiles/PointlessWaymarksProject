This library uses authorization code translated from the Python [matin/garth: Garmin SSO auth + Connect Python client](https://github.com/matin/garth) and API Code from [sealbro/dotnet.garmin.connect: Unofficial garmin connect client](https://github.com/sealbro/dotnet.garmin.connect). The translation was helped by the [philosowaffle/peloton-to-garmin: Convert workout data from Peloton into JSON/TCX/FIT files and automatically upload to Garmin Connect](https://github.com/philosowaffle/peloton-to-garmin) project - they did the first C# Garth version I'm aware of and I was very glad that code was available! Special thanks to the Garth project for the access it helps provide for [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com) - Garmin makes excellent durable GPS devices and has improved and kept Garmin Connect free for over a decade - amazing! Garmin does not have as strong a story around API access and the Garth project fills a real gap for individuals who want to work with their own data... MIT License.

The PointlessWaymarks.GarminConnect library provides access to Activities in the Garmin Connect API. Because the Pointless Waymarks project only needs a select set of features (and because this code is fairly new at this point!) there are some limitations:
 - Multifactor Authentication is not supported
 - Each new Context will create a new login - at present using the Refresh Token to create longer lived logins is not supported
 - Only limited Activity related APIs are supported
