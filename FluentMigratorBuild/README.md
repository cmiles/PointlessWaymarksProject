Once I was used to some of the SqlLite limitations [fluentmigrator/fluentmigrator: Fluent migrations framework for .NET](https://github.com/fluentmigrator/fluentmigrator) project has been a great way to update the Database for various PointlessWaymarks apps. For sometime I've had a problem with FluentMigrator and SingleFile deployments - I recently looked more carefully at the error and what I could do. After working on some sample projects and trying the [fluentmigrator - Azure Artifacts](https://dev.azure.com/fluentmigrator/fluentmigrator/_artifacts/feed/fluentmigrator) feed the error free solution for the functionality that these project use that seemed to be the cleanest atm is to use output from the current FluentMigrations code (these are from a 12/3 download).

DO NOT USE THESE DLLs IN OTHER PROJECTS => I do not have enough insight into the FluentMigrator project to understand what challenges/problems there are with this version, using these solved problems for this project but you should either use the official sources or build/research this yourself.
